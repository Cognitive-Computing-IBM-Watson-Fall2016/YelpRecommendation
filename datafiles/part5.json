{"text": "Visited Charlotte during my vacation and must say this is one of the nicest more friendly people I met during my road trip and the service at this restaurant was par to none.  My server was very polite and helpful.  My comment to her after passing the menu right back to her was \"Suprise Me\".\n   What she started me off with perfectly stuffed fresh spring rolls.  I have had rolls from many asian restaurants, but non had this much shrimp inside.  Being use to other places that slice the shrimp and put less than half at times in the roll.  These were filled very nice and had great flavor.\n   She kept my tea glass full, which might I add I did not use any sugar.  It was fresh and tasted right.\n   My entree came out and it was pepper beef I think.  Crispy beef.  Great flavor, done so well with great seasoning and the rice was tender and nice.\n   I thoroughly enjoyed this visit to this business.  Stop in and enjoy. So very busy at 8pm on Sunday.   Came to Charlotte while on vacation and it was on my route.  Parked at the Hearst Media Towers and just went walking.  I saw Mert's and looked up on Yelp and the reviews got me in.  Now, let's be clear on this.  This location is in a nice building, next to a nice Holiday Inn; so don't expect fancy NOTHING.\n   The inside looks very well broken in but yet clean and eclectic. Iron metal art sculptures with wood adorn the inside, the kitchen area is open and you can see everything.  There was only two guys back there and may GOD bless them both, they were rockin out some GREAT FLAVOR.\n   I was promptly seated then greeted by my server whom said she would be right back to take my order.  As I said this place was busy so I figured I would be waiting on my food.  NOT THE CASE.   As with most places I visit first I say to the servers \"Please bring me food.  Your choice, Your call.  Don't tell me.\"  Then I list what I don't eat.  I also asked for sweet tea.\n    Understanding that this is soul food, real soul food.  So I was excited.  The tea came, glass was clean.  The tea.  Well, the first glass went down fast and was refilled quickly by my server with a smile.\n   Within a few minutes my food was delivered by another server.  Fried Chicken, green beans, and mac & cheese, with cornbread.  I'm happy.\n    The green beans had great flavor, very nicely cooked.  The mac & cheese is incredible, was tempted to order a side bowl of this but, hey, already ate like 4 times prior.  I picked the chicken up, white meat; and tried to bite into it.  WRONG!!!!!!!!!!\n     I warn you, wait for 20 to 30 minutes till you can get into this.  HOW THE HECK IS IT SO HOT FOR SO LONG?  Darn..  I had to cut into it with a knife to let the heat out.  Once it was safe to eat it, I was first taken to the memory of my mothers and grandma's chicken that was made at home.  Perfectly seasoned, not greasy, but just pure flavor and moist.  I finished off several more glasses of that great sweet tea and cleaned my plate.\n    Total bill was about $11, I forgot to keep the receipt, but was well worth it and the server was taken very good care of.\n    She offered cake for desert but it was HUGE, no way I could have eaten that and still be functional to see the town that night.  \n     Only downside to this place is that it is right off the street, so you get noise from the traffic and flies find their way in.  No biggie, they did not eat much.  \n     So if you live within a couple of hours, this place rocks.  Service is great.  \nHappy Eating...", "user_id": "41yN_fJ70MRGEYYvV0aUGw", "business_id": "rT-iPtIXMKj3dTcl87lbOw"}
{"text": "This is damn good NY style pizza.  Ground Beef, Pepperoni and Onion cooked well done is the family fave.  Not in the mood for pizza?  Don't despair as all the subs, hot and cold are delicious.  The bread helps make them.  Imported from a bakery in NJ and that perfect marriage of crisp and light and chewy.  Meatballs.  Great value for 6 small ones swimming in delicious sauce for less than $3.  \n\nOMG...  Am making myself hungry and its only time for breakfast.  Good thing we got some to-go last night so the fridge is full of leftovers!  Yes... The slices are good cold too :) Alexander Michael's is one of those places I've known about for years but was dumb enough not to bookmark so it would only cross my mind when I was nowhere near the place. Then finally, one day my wife and I were head south from LKN around lunchtime and miracle of miracles, I remembered. Very glad I did!\n\nReally nice homey feeling as soon as we walked in and we were greeted quickly and in a welcoming way. There were many things on the menu that sounded wonderful and she landed on a burger and I had a blackened chicken sandwich which you can also get grilled or teriyaki-style. We felt both were great. In fact, the only thing we tried that was just good vs great was the spicy crab soup. \n\nThe service continued the theme from the nice greeting and our food came out quickly. Al Mike's is absolutely the kind of place any neighborhood would welcome. What can one say about Morton's other than bring a fat wallet and prepare yourself for a steak dinner as it should be.   Properly aged and cooked prime beef in monstrous proportions.  Supremely huge and good sides. Was that a football or a baked potato?  Stellar if a bit snooty service. It's all here. It's a chain but a damn good one... I like Matt's because they make most everything right to order so the burgers, fries, etc are always piping hot and fresh.  It takes a bit longer than not doing this way but the trade off is well worth it.  Love the Italian Beef, Char Dog and Fire Dog as well.\n\nThis location is really convenient to my office so I find myself there at least a couple times a month and will continue doing so as long as they remain consistent in what they do. Tasty, if unremarkable, Chinese fare is what to expect from China King. You can get in and out quickly, even during the lunch crush if you go through the cafeteria type line and order. There you will find pretty standard items like General Tso's chicken, spicy pork, beef with broccoli, etc. Ordering from the menu gets you more variety but a bit longer wait. Food is good but not great and when they call something spicy, it's only mildly so most of the time. Pretty fair place to satisfy that MSG hankering when in uptown however. I'm somewhat embarrassed about this review as I work in Uptown, love this kind of cooking, have known Mert's existed but have never gone!  Remedied that on Wednesday morning and seriously had perhaps the best breakfast I've ever had.\n\nI got just the basics - scrambled eggs, sausage, home fries, biscuit and a buttermilk pancake on the side.  OMFG!  Perfectly cooked eggs, two huge sausage patties that were seared on the outside and moist/tender on the inside (yes they were cooked through!)  :)  Everything was just as I would order a breakfast if it were my last breakfast on earth.  My wife had similar but substituted bacon, grits and a sweet potato pancake. she was in breakfast nirvana as well.  Even the coffee was a notch above your typical breakfast joint fare.\n\nAND...  As I sat there eating this deliciousness, I had to stare at the lunch special menu board and there was not one thing on it I wouldn't have ordered.  There is no doubt I'm coming back soon for lunch.\n\nOn the service side it was fast, friendly and really nice teamwork among the servers with everyone paying attention to coffee cups getting low, etc.  What a jewel for the Queen City!", "user_id": "wGWFzdgnSEe7C6UjoW8Q3g", "business_id": "sJtGRBWYUj013nkFA4Hrdg"}
{"text": "You will feel transported to Germany (well, close enough) when you come up the drive for the quaint, authentic building.  5 yelp stars for the beer and the beer list.  The pretzel rolls that came gratis were excellent, and would have been worth an app price if served with a good beer cheese.  The  weiner schnitzel was average good.  It came on a jaeger (brown, mushroom) sauce, which is not traditional at all.  The rouladen was pretty good.  For those not in the know - rouladen is like a rolled up burger with bacon and pickles.  Pretty good!  \n\nBut - Where are the dirndls and lederhosen on the wait staff??  And no German music, no background music at all.  A small touch of ambiance, but authentic music would go a long way.  Our server was from Honduras, and wasn't familiar with German food, but he was honest about the sauerbraten being dry (true) and he was jovial and sincere.  Excellent option for German in Charlotte!  Hoping to come back for Oktoberfest in our dirndl and lederhosen!  Prost!! During my one visit (before a big rock concert), Ri Ra'swas crowded and loud while we were there.  They were doing trivia in the back of the place, which was fine, but a little distracting if you weren't involved in the game.  Also, we put our name on a wait list and were never called . . . ever.  Ending up eating at the bar.  Speaking of the bar - the drinks were pretty weak.  I literally wondered if I was drinking watered down bourbon because I didn't taste a tone of ginger OR bourbon in my bourbon and ginger.  The highlight was the food, at least mine.  I got the brisket sandwich and fries.  The brisket was very tender and everything had good flavor.  I asked for a side of the curry sauce and I do not kid or exaggerate to say it is out of this world good.  If they had sold it in to go containers, I would have bought some to take home.  My friends both got the Reuben and described it as somewhat chewy.  I don't think I've ever had a \"chewy\" Reuben, so that wasn't very promising.  So, in any case, \"a-ok\".  I'd go back and give it a second shot when in Charlotte. I wanted to like this place more than I actually did.  Starting with a positive - the cornbread was sensational, served piping hot with honey butter.  Our server 'fessed up it was made with mayo when I pressed for deets.  Lawdy have mercy!  It was durn good though.  The fried chicken was just as excellent as you expect.  Collards and okra got a thumbs up from me.  Okay - now for the negs - The salmon cakes were downright not good.   Disappointing, as they were touted as a featured menu item on their website.  I wonder if I just got them on a bad day??  They were mushy, with no discernible salmon chunks, and flavorless, desperately needing spices or at least salt.  I saw and tasted no evidence of the mirepoix and Cajun spices described as part of the dish.  Hubs didn't like his green beans (too sweet) and home fries (too bland, not fried long enough).  \n\nI like the vibe of the space a lot.  But it does seem a little dirty.  Also our server was very friendly but repeatedly sneezed into the crook of her arm and just kept on serving.  Um, kinda gross from a customer perspective.  She also mixed our ticket up with another tables, but then let us know that she would cover the extra on their ticket for us.  They were busy.  These things happen.  \n\nAll in all, I think this is worth a visit for out of towners, especially if you are staying right down town.  But, I'll try somewhere else next time I'm in Charlotte - hence 3 stars.", "user_id": "ceuqjwWQxcpJ_bZE7-9l-w", "business_id": "2_0P2AmSSFtPgddio0MgYA"}
{"text": "I don't like to give out one stars and I don't give them out lightly without an explanation. I was out driving looking for yard sales in the area when we passed this cute little restaurant. I figured it was probably going to be some amazing southern cooking and my heart was craving some delicious buttered pancakes. To my dismay they were done with breakfast once we arrived. Ah well. No big deal.\n\nWe sat at our table and it took a bit for our server to come and talk to us, and there were only a couple people there. I felt as if our being there was an inconvenience and I was pretty bummed since I'd had such high expectations of the place. We ordered Mt. Dew & when they brought it out, it was in a can. So, obviously, no free refills. Ok. That I was even sort of ok with... \n\nWell when our food came out, I ordered the veggie plate, which was 3 sides. A salad with ranch dressing, mashed potatoes and gravy & corn were my meal & my boyfriend ordered the roast beef special that the server swore by. \n\nMy salad came out and it had only lettuce on the plate with a gallon of ranch dressing. No carrots, cheese, onions or anything but it had a slice of tomato that appeared to have mold on it. Gross. I ate a few bites of the lettuce drenched in ranch before I noticed the tomato & then I pushed it aside. My boyfriend tried the roast beef and said it was so chewy he had to grind it against his teeth for awhile to chew it up & it was just bland in general. \n\nI took a bite of the potatoes because at that point I figure it was the best thing I'd be eating at this place. I stuck them in my mouth and wow... they were flavorless. It was seriously like I'd taken a bite of textured air. Really??? So I said nothing and offered a bite to my boyfriend to see what his reaction was because I knew he wouldn't believe me if I told him. \n\nHe took the bite and stopped chewing immediately and looked at me with a questioning look, and said, \"Gross.\" The corn was good but that was seriously the only thing I could even eat. He ate a portion of his sandwich and left the rest because he just couldn't do it. I was actually a little angry by this point because I can't believe a place that has been around so long could be this terrible. \n\nWhen we got the bill, it was almost $30!!!!! Yeah and those cans of pop we ordered, $1.50 each! Ridiculous. I will never return to this place and if you're driving by I wouldn't recommend it. Really sad about this one. I was perusing my old reviews and realized that I had a response for the one star rating I had left. I always appreciate when an owner reaches out, and Sara informed me that this place is under new management and promises that it would have people raving over how delicious it is!! If I lived in the area I'd love to come back out and give it another shot. Based on the new reviews I think Sara would definitely deliver the experience I'd originally hoped for :D I REEEEAAALLY wanted to like Mert's...Any place that has Heart and Soul in the name has to be delicious in my opinion. First, I will say, I will give Mert's another chance in the future. I went on a Friday night after work and it was crammed full. \nI took that as a good sign because that many people here has to say something right?? We were quickly seated, the food came out fast and I don't really have any complaints about that.I ordered the Salmon Cakes with mashed potatoes and green beans. I thought this would be a glowing review based on what I'd heard, and how crazy busy the place was. \nThe salmon cakes were pretty good, potatoes were so so, and I don't even remember if the green beans were good... I'm just sort of disappointed based on what I thought it would be like. The service was ok, nothing extraordinary and I felt the same about the food I ordered. Shortly after walking out, my stomach was so upset, and stayed that way for a couple of days.\nThe best thing about this place was the corn bread, and the sweet butter. Perhaps next time I'll listen to the other reviews and go for the chicken?", "user_id": "hYpCpleBxL5h4jz3HeNqGw", "business_id": "PVooCeYIrp9E2rtrL4R98g"}
{"text": "I give this restaurant a barely made it 3. It was meh.\n\nFirst time here. Just in town for a convention and not a lot of restaurants were open like 9pm. We debated hooters across the street or this. Wanted something new so we picked this restaurant.\n\nWalked in with the party of 7 and the host said if there are more people coming for your party I can't accommodate you more than that coz of limited seating. Understandable but I think he could've said it differently. \n\nRestaurant is very steakhouse cozy. A little bit pub vibe, very small and quite dark. They have a bar. We were seated on high chairs. \n\nMenu personally I didn't think they offered a lot of choices but that's a personal preference. I ordered the calamari, my friends ordered fried fish sandwich, burgers and a chicken fajita.\n\nThe food took forever. I was even looking at other tables who were waiting on their food staring at each other or the ceiling. \n\nWhen we got our food, you would expect it to be hot. It's not. I guess with our big party some of the food was still cooking and some were already sitting out. My friends said the same thing. The temperature of food felt like it has been sitting there.\n\nI liked my calamari a lot though and the waitress said I got more than the usual quantity it comes with. My friends said their food was good. But good as in okay. Nothing too crazy. Price upwards of $10+.\n\nPersonally, I didn't didn't really have a good first time experience. I don't think I will go back either. I definitely would rather have spent my money on hooters. But I will give huge credit to our waitress. I really suck at names. She was very patient and polite. Knew her stuff and accommodated our take pretty well. Other than that, blah. This review I would say would be a pretty weak 4 star.\n\nFirst time here. I was in town for a conference and me and my friends just did Crossfit so I asked the concierge at my hotel to direct me to a place where I can get my grub on... \n\nHe asks like chicken and stuff? I said like Mac and cheese and ribs and all that Good stuff lol and this is where it brought me.\n\nIt's a small southern comfort food style place. My expectations ran high as I saw Guy Fieri \"was here\". Plus who could go wrong with comfort food right?\n\nThe restaurant hours didn't close till about half an hour after we walked in.\n\nAnd one of the waiters didn't want to sit us in his area because he didn't want to serve any more tables on his side. Well thanks Pal. The restaurant really isn't that big.\n\nAnywhooooo...\n\nWe ordered and our waitress was kind of snappy. I guess she was overwhelmed and tired that day that she wanted to close the restaurant already. \n\nI wanted to order the ribs with Mac and cheese and string bean. But the waitress informed us there wasn't anymore. Okay... How about the corn on the cob? We're out of that too. \n\nAs I grew frustrated and hungry, I just opted out totally off the second side dish. Out of everything , I was looking forward to the Mac and cheese more than anything.\n\nOur cornbread came right away, served nice and warm. delicious! But our entrees took a while.\n\nThen a miracle happened! The kitchen staff was so kind enough to make a batch of fresh Mac and cheese. Praise the Lord!\n\nAnd purely because of that reason, I gave them one extra star for that really kind gesture.\n\nOur food came and it really was a mouthful. My ribs was DROWNED in sauce and oil. Tasted good like any other ribs to me. Mac and cheese was great. String bean was really soggy . I don't know if it should look like that on purpose.\n\nPrice is around $8 and up and they do have combos.\n\nPersonally, I didn't think this place was that special. Just a good Comfort food place that's all.\n\nRecommend for a grub.", "user_id": "vlyj0sEDEQk-HEiiLWQh1w", "business_id": "vIXUw1cLG84-m8LzOg3f-w"}
{"text": "i've been here a few times. I called my order in #5 (Cheesburger combo w/ fries). Once I walked in I stood in line waiting (while CHECKING IN to Yelp) to get to the counter to pick my order up. \n\nOnce the line dwindled down, i said i was here to pick up an order, She said my name (made me wonder if i was the only person to call a order in... DURING LUNCH). \n\nOk, you ordered a MUSHROOM SWISS BURGER (photo taken) w/ chips.\nUmmmm, NOoooo!! I ordered a number 5. Cheesebuger Combo w/ Fries & Drink\n\nafter a brief embarrasing moment. I was offered a \"Mushroom Swiss Burger\". Well I didn't order it 1st of all, But I LOVE FOOD, and havn't tried it before. So i say, \"sure\" why not (i didn't want them to throw it away either...no one wins in that case). So i asked for Fries (as originally ordered). I was given Fries and i was able to keep the CHIPS. (cool, i've never had them b4 either) chips are pretty good.\n\nSo, I get back to the office ready to tear into this burger. So... my first bite was filled with Mushrooms. Made me think, \"whoever ORDERED this must REALLLLY REALLLY REALLY LIKE MUSHROOMS... it was loaded w/ them and onions. bacon, & swiss. \n\nNotta bad burger at all. I would probably get it again and ask for LIGHT MUSHROOMS. \n\n*** also, once i got to the counter the young lady told me in a motherly fashion... THE NEXT TIME U CALL IN A ORDER.... DON'T WAIT IN LINE.. JUST COME RIGHT UP. with a big smile. (that was cool, considering while IN LINE on YELP i read that was the thing to do... smh.i gotta start reading faster.. it would have saved me 3-6mins)\n\nSooo all in all, even though i didn't get what i ordred, i was fine with the mistake made.

Now it looks like it survied Katrina. \n\nFish - Not like it used to be.\nMac * Cheese - i agree w/ other reviews\nokra - you'll probably get about 12 pieces (15 if your nice)\nwhat happend to the plates, cups?? (as in real plates, spoons, forks etc) its all plastic and styrofoam.. signs the money is tigtening up.)\n\niF i return it will be just to speak and maybe pick up a drink (tea).

{"text": "Old reliable. This place knows how to fit my lunch needs in a major way. I try to get here atleast once a week. They have some of the best chinese food in town.\n\nThe twins that work the front are awesome and transition everybody in and out as efficiently as possible. They have yet to mess up my order, despite being extremely overcrowded.\n\nThe food is tremendous and fresh. Their edimames are to die for. The steam them and salt them to perfection. If you are uptown and are craving chinese food, go to soho bistro.\n\n7 on the legitimate big dog scale here. This place is as reliable as you can ever imagine. That's what's good. No doubt am I fan. Whether this LBD is craving mac and cheese or collard greens, I know where to go.\n\nI usually order online on \"uptown2go\", so I know to give it about 20 minutes before collecting my meal. Lately, I have been a huge fan of their bbq sandwich. It comes on top of a buttered roll. Now if that doesn't get it poppin, what does?\n\nBeing a northern boy, I never really had the opportunity to munch out on some soul food. Let me tell you, this place has gotten me addicted to collard greens. \n\nThey also have good beans and cornbread. And when I want some beans and cornbread, I will go to Mert's for some beans and cornbread. If it wasn't for their beans and cornbread, I'd go somewhere else for my beans and cornbread.\n\nLBD Scale- Easy 8. Now doubt in my mind that this place is a trademark southern soul food boutique. If there's any other places that you recommend, holla at me. But right this second, I'm all about Mert's. I WANT SOME MERT'S IN MY MOUTH! Holy mackerel was this place amazing!! LBD status to the max.\n\nMy father, cousin, bro in law, grandfather, and uncle all decided to come down for a weekend for some bball, football, & brews brew. I researched some places to take them to dinner. I'm tired of the traditional places here in Uptown (Blue, Cap Grille, etc), so I decided to try something new. Working at BofA and living on 7th, I rarely have the opportunity to venture down Tryon. This has opened my eyes to a whole new world, just like Aladdin.\n\nNot taking any chances, I made reservations for the 6 of us. For 7 pm, I really don't feel this would have been necessary, as the place was practically completely empty. Let me give you the run down of everything we ate. Please don't judge me. I know I'm a gavone :)\n___________________________________________________\nAppetizers\n\nLobster Mac & Cheese: Thought this was the worst of what we ate. Still, would order it again. Has a completely different texture of your traditional mac & cheese. \n\nCornbread: Comes out in a hot skillet with melted pecan butter on top. Do I need to say anything more about this?\n\nPei Mussels: WOW. The flavor of these mussels will stay with me for the rest of my life. The way they not only smelled, but tasted :)\n\nShrimp & Grits: A teacher of mine used to say: \"So good, it'll make you want to slap yo mama.\" Yeah, that applies here.\n\nPork Belly Sliders: This could have been my meal and I'd be completely happy. I NEED THESE AGAIN!\n\nStuffed Hushpuppies: Halved-hushpuppies, stuffed with crawfished and rock shrimp. This was the complete showstopper. It was spicy, but tasted so damn good.\n\nSome Special Bean Soup: I honestly don't remember the name of it, but it made me all warm and tingly inside. It was in like a beef broth with veggies, beens, and chunks of ham. Splendid\n____________________________________________________\nDinner (yeah, we had room for this too)\n\n\"Old World\" Duck: This was the biggest piece of duck I have ever seen. It was cooked to complete perfection and had the perfect complimentary side of butternut squash. \n\nHickory Beef Tenderloin: A hunk of beef, thrown onto a plate with phenomenal ( and i mean PHENOMENAL) risotto. I devoured this thing faster than you can read this off the menu.\n\n\"Duroc\" Pork Chop: Although I did not have the pleasure of enjoying this, my cuz pounded it (not pounded out). It's a traditional pork chop, but with fresh homemade apple sauce along the side of it. He did not finish at the table, but instead finished while sitting in his underwear on my couch at midnight.\n\n\n\nSo I decided to give this place 5 stars. But if you have read my reviews before, stars don't mean anything. It's all about the LBD scale, and let me tell you, this gets a 9.5 on the LBD scale. If I gave such raving reviews regarding the food, why a 9.5 you ask? BECAUSE I didn't get to try their desert. I'd be lying if I gave it a perfect 10 (like Scarlett Johannson) and it has a terrible desert. I will definitely be back there and will adjust the LBD scale accordingly.", "user_id": "F8rOtCtfmhBeBQRK6gyD0w", "business_id": "rT-iPtIXMKj3dTcl87lbOw"}
{"text": "Love this place for its micro beers and spicy crab soup. The london broil looks amazing but i did not try it. Five people at my table ordered and greedily scarfed it down leaving crumbs not even fit for a mouse. Hehe ya that good! Can't wait to waunder in again and i love that they have local meats on there menu.\nOur server was so sweet too. I must say i absolutely love the farm to table feel of montecello soon to be harvest moon grille! In the west you see more of this concept but im excited that the south is coming too realize this concept is so very important. Having the oppurtunity to meet several people who talked highly of this restaurantbi was highly excited to find out id be going to brunch.\nMy friend and i went to brunch and we split the butternut crunch salad, bank moon and the pork belly holendaise. My favorite dish was the salad. Totally dig the julliened raw butternut squah. Apples we're a good accompinmentt. The bank moon was a traditional vietnameese sandwich with a knock ur socks off aioli. The pork belly hollendaise was to be honest not the best i have had due to the hollendaise lacking much seasoning but at least it was freshly made win lhocal eggs. Perhaps a little more lemon and salt? The pork belly was deliscious and not incredably fatty which means it was properly rendered. Im not a grit fan but hey im a northerner. \nOverall the searvice was amazing friendly and attentive. Totally digged the dark roast on the coffee. \nCan't wait to come back for dinner! On a cold night that just happened to be my birthday, my friend and I strutted into Mimosa awaiting an experience. We had reservations and were promptly seated next to a window that looked out on a beautiful city view. The restaurant is warm, inviting and cozy... yet its a decently large area. I had really high hopes for this meal and there were hits and misses throughout. Either way I had a fabulous birthday.\n\nStarting out with the service... WOW! Its been a while since I had that good of service, especially in North Carolina for that matter! Our server was a dashing fellow by the name of Adam and he definatly made our night. I think that his great attitude and subtle humor made my review jump up a star. Our water was always filled, food was coursed very well, and Adam showed great knowledge in the menu.\n\nNow getting to the menu, which in itself was a bit of a cluster-F. I like more of a structure in a menu, perferably with no advertisements or noncense. I like Structured menus I guess. Maybe I am just nit-picky. At any rate we started off our meal with all recomandations from our server. The trio of Pear Salad was first. Three applications of pears were showcased, the only one that needed to be on there was the savory cheese cake with pears. The other two were nice but the cheese cake was rad. Then we enjoyed the blt Belly Sliders and the stuffed hushpuppies. I think the Belly Sliders were good... but I think they required salt, I felt that belly fat plus fried tomato could definatly benefit. The hushpuppies... no complaints. \nNow the thing I was looking forward too was this pork chop with foraged mushroom mac and braised greens. We ordered our porkchop medium/rare and what we got was... well nicely seared but the inside was so bloody red it looked like seared ahi! We sent it back and by then there was no hope left... Alas! an overdone chop. If something is sent back I would be sure to watch it like a hawk! While the mac was good I really wanted a good porkchop. \n\nThe meal as a whole was good, save the chop. Im not sure that their \"farm to plate\" Ideal came across incredibly well, but I like the initiative. Definatly a delightful evening.", "user_id": "ctXZwLnGALfazigC5e-zxg", "business_id": "ePP0Eqz8JKSbtdt2phiB4A"}
{"text": "Loved this place.  It isn't the nicest/cleanest place in Charlotte, but it the best bang for your buck.  I love hot dogs and they know how to get it done!! These dogs are delicious!  The green dog is so special because it is so simple.  A long time tradition, this greek owned hot dog joint knows what they are selling.  Give it a try for an el cheapo luncho.. Trust me.\n\nEnjoy.\n\n-Ian M. Chicago is only minutes away from uptown Charlotte.  Didn't you know that?  Well, Matt's Chicago hot dogs were as close to authentic as you are going to get in North Carolina.  \n\nChicago Dog Ingredients: Check \nRestaurant Ambiance: Excellent (Check)\nOutdoor Seating in a Park: Check\n\nGoing back for many more hotdogs:  CHECK!!\n\nThey also offer combos so you can wash down the dog with some delicious fries and a soda.  There are several other options besides the Chicago dog if you are feeling adventurous.  They also offer burgers etc etc.  I haven't tried the burgers yet and it may be a while because I'm going to keep getting the dogs.  I love hot dogs.  Enjoy!!\n\n-Ian M. I really liked their beer selections.  This place is a nice hometown \"big\" bar.  Not chain-like.  The staff wasnt the friendliest but the food, beer, and prices made up for that.  I would definitely suggest checking it out on a NFL SUnday too. Whole lot of TVs.  \n\nEnjoy\n\nIan M. This is my type of place.  If you like sports, app food, and cold beer.  Welcome home.  They have two different types of dining areas.  One is a sports dungeon that doesnt see an ounce of sun, and the other is a lounge type relaxing couch zone.  TVs everywhere!!  \n\nAs far as hotel bars go, this location stands out.  It has a entrance/exit to the outside so its not like you have to go through the hotel or anything.  Enjoy!\n\n-Ian M. Nothing here really blew me away..  Yeah, it's pretty cool that they brew their own beers and they are located on Tryon but... eh.  This spot is one step above an Applebees.  Dont get me wrong, I kinda like Applebees.  Just dont expect anything amazing.  I would suggest sitting outside and enjoying a nice day.  That might make it a little better.  I would also suggest you try the artichoke/crab dip.  That was rather delicious.  I would say, give it a try but know.. There are much better places in the city.  Enjoy!\n\n-Ian M. Ok.. Maybe I went here at the wrong time or something but I have to put in my two cents.  This is not a really cool hang out.  The bar is really small and the staff was really unfriendly.  I went around 5pm on a Tuesday, but I don't think that was the problem.  The place just seemed small and shabby to me.  Im sorry to bash it because there are a lot of really good reviews here.  So just take my review with a grain of salt.  I will update my review when I give it a second chance and make it through my beer and order some food.  Sorry guys.. I would say make your way deeper into the city and try someplace else.  \n\nI gave it one star at first.. That was too harsh.. \n\n-Ian M. Truffle Fries!!  Wow!  I am only writing a review on the total ambiance and bar menu.  I didnt actually get a chance to sit down and have dinner but that will inevitably happen soon.  The location and atmosphere is simply wonderful.  We sat inside at the bar on a Friday during happy hour and things started jumping.  Not jumping like packed and annoying, just enjoyable with people all over the place.  The bartender/staff was very attentive and very good at her job.  That is nice.  Just outside is a large patio area over looking a beautiful courtyard in the city.  Great location!  \n\nTruffle fries.... Now, the only other fries that I have ever had that didnt require and condiments were at Capital Grille.  They were $10 fries.  They are $4 here and simply delicious.  I will be going back many times to this place just for those fries (see picture).  Also stay tuned for update about the dinner menu.  Very soon.   Enjoy!\n\n-Ian M.", "user_id": "afTF61m7-hcOWAZ-FXc86Q", "business_id": "LT0AgHTpDifuHSXgyLmJwg"}
{"text": "If you don't already know this, Irish Pubs are known equally as well for their booze (ales, whiskey, and lager!) as they are for their \"pub food.\" I award 5 stars to Ri Ra for exemplifying the latter quality in its lunch menu. Granted, the place only offers sandwiches (and salads too I guess) at noon, but they are absolutely, positively, worth the trip. \n\nAlmost everdyday the lunch menu offers a \"special,\" which tends to be the most succulent sandwich filler one could ever conjure up in their kitchen. They take a perfectly roasted pork loin, for example, and carve thick slices, which are then layered on top of a freshly baked roll. These rolls are never crunchy or stale; they don't cut the roof of your mouth when you bite in (ouch!), nor do they get soggy when adding condoments. I'm not quite sure how this phenomenon is achieved, but it's kudos-worthy. I hate when my tomato becomes part of the bread. BLEAGH. These rolls on the contrary, are so fresh and soft, they're practically falling apart, until glued in place by the panini grill. Unlike other delis/lunch spots, you should keep your sandwich simple, because the ingredients and toppings are so fresh and flavorful it would be a shame to spoil the fun. The special pork sandwich with mustard, cheese, lettuce, and tomato is mind-bogglingly good, and I have often heard that the turkey with cranberry being referred to as \"Christmas in a bun.\" You decide.\n\nAND YOU GET A PICKLE!! I mean seriously, just when you thought life couldn't get any better, you get a pickle for the win. \n\nI'll definitely be filling out my loyalty card here (8 sandwiches, get one free). And you need to be beating the lunch rush, because once the special is out.... its OUT. Word has gotten out about the magic that happens at Ri Ra though, so don't get left behind :P\n\n5/5 This is one of my ideal lunch spots even though it's the longest walk away. With a simplistic concept and an efficient assembly line, The Sandwich Club is perfect for on-the-go sandwiches. A sandwich + chips might cost you up to $10 so don't be alarmed when you hit the register. Moreover, the chips, parfaits, drinks, and cookies will surely tempt you while you wait in line. How strategic of them.\n\nThe kicker at this joint is the customization that's available to you. It's like Starbucks, but for sandwiches. You could have your 'wich any way you like. The menu isn't restricting. They have several different mustards, toppings, and spreads. And they load the meat on the bread - like a real deli! \n\nThe quality of the fillings are of a high quality too, that's for sure. Everything tastes fresh and the bread just barely holds the filling. I like #27, their signature Sandwich Club, which includes BLT + Chicken Salad. I add dijon. It's a pretty filling order and I'd say a good 800 calories after licking up the remaining crumbs. \n\nIf you're into gorging at lunch time, they have a number of \"cutlet\" sandwiches which are basically fried filets of chicken in sandwich form. Chicken Parm and Popeye's are pretty delicioso. \n\nI don't see the need to comment on service since it's not a sit down place. Plus at lunch time, these people are working hard, I'm always going to cut them some slack. After all, they're running a business, not a meet n' greet. \n\nYet another strictly sandwich deli for you to try out :)\n\n4/5 Mimosa!\n\nMan, it's hard to judge this restaurant because I seem to have such highs and lows here! Nowhere in between.\n\nI usually come here every week on Sunday morning to get at that all-you-can-eat brunch for ~$20! The food can be hit or miss at times, but the staples of crispy bacon, fried eggs and fresh mimosa never cease to amaze! Sunday brunches showcase some of this place's creativity because certain menu items (the specials, quiches and desserts) constantly change with the week and season. The food overall is just alright, but if you don't want to cook and need a lot of choice (indecisive), this is the place for you. \n\nDuring the week, I come here regularly to pick up my dinner because it's close by and my workday is long. They have a great corporate menu that lets you have a $20 (tax included) dinner that comes with entree, salad and two sides. Your choice is grilled chicken, steak, or salmon with sides of fries, mashed potatoes, green beans, or spinach (can't remember the rest). I will admit, for the most part the taste is rich and delicious, but their execution is so inconsistent. Occasionally the salmon is undercooked, or the chicken charred on one side, or the mashed potatoes liquidy. And once I recieved my food 50 minutes after ordering... but more often than not, I am pleased with the efficiency and quality that I'm paying for. \n\nI would say this is a pretty sweet spot for brunch and a convenient place to grab dinner, but don't always expect it to be \"like last time.\"\n\n4/5", "user_id": "SZ56K9vxIEid0KoqZjFwkQ", "business_id": "WuCcv_Dyd_1B_1-4jwK7sQ"}
{"text": "Neat little Chinese bistro in the heart of Uptown. Service was excellent and the atmosphere is intimate. \n\nI'm guessing this is a Hong Kong style place? A fair mix of Cantonese and Mandarin dishes, including some Curry Noodles, Cantonese Rice Noodles, Sha Cha Chicken and a ton of seafood dishes including (!) Mahi Mahi.\n\nI went with the Cantonese Noodles and they were around a B/B+. I think they could have made the noodles much spicier and gone heavier on the seasonings. My friend ordered a General Tso's Tofu, which was delightfully crispy and sweet on the outside but perfectly soft on the inside. He also ordered the Teriyaki Chicken appetizer which was served satay-style on a skewer. This again was good, though fairly dumbed-down for what (I assume) the owners think is a spice-averse audience in Charlotte.\n\nSo, in spite of the good review, my message to SoHo is this: DON'T BE AFRAID TO MAKE THE FOOD MORE AUTHENTIC. BE BRAVE! Look, you might be thinking most Americans want bland Chinese food - but, the times, they are a changin'. There are a ton of culturally educated, adventurous foodies out there and they are DYING for legit Chinese cuisine. Go forth and give us a place to call home! The ONLY reason this place gets two stars and not one is because our server was fantastic: he split our bills no problem, didn't screw up water orders, put up with a colleague's silly antics, and got our food to us promptly. \n\nThe food was bad, yo. Like, below Applebee's bad. We split an order of guacamole. For $8.50, you get a tiny dish of it and a bunch of chips in a little bucket. What a crock. The guacamole was fine, but for $8.95, you can go to Vida over at Epicenter and get (as I wrote in a previous review) a veritable fuck-ton of it prepared tableside.\n\nI also ordered the Southwestern Turkey burger. It sounded delightful - peppers mixed in with the meat, jack cheese, fried jalepe\u00f1os - but tasted like garbage. The meat was tasteless but spicy, the jalepe\u00f1os were in five tiny bits on top of the burger, the cheese was like plastic. The bun was overly bread-y. I ordered with a side of fruit, which was disappointingly not fresh.\n\nMy colleagues complained that their food sucked too: overly dry burger for $10 and a dried out piece of salmon for $18.50. What the fuck.\n\nPeople, don't go here unless you want to get ripped off and eat shitty food. Took my parents here for brunch on a Sunday. First of all, decor is classy, but the carpet near the windows is torn up and stained. A place that gets this much traffic *absolutely* should have the extra dough to spend on replacing the carpet. So, that gets a low mark in my book.\n\nAs for the brunch itself, it was very Charlotte. That is to say, what you'd expect Charlotte to do well, it did great. It failed in other categories. \n\nWhat was good: the grilled salmon was phenomenal. I think they used hickory. Just awesome. Eggs, green beans, mac and cheese were all above par. Another VERY UNUSUAL offering was smoked salmon with caviar garnishes (chopped eggs, red onion, capers). Is this a dish that is unique to Charlotte or the south? (I liked it, although I would have MUCH preferred to eat my caviar garnishes with caviar (including blini and sour cream).) For dessert, there were giant chocolate-dipped strawberries. \n\nAlso unique to this place is the all you can eat made-to-order tapas menu that comes with brunch. The walnut-crusted French toast with mixed berries was sublime. The classic eggs benedict was good, not great.\n\nWhat was bad: they had an appetizer selection of cheese and fruit that was unimaginative, unappealing and un-quality (yes I made that word up to get the point across). Generic cubed hard cheeses and melon and strawberries that were under-ripe and looked like they hadn't been vetted for quality. The shrimp and grits was absolutely awful: a soup of gravy, some overcooked tomatoes and you had to fish around for the damn shrimp. The prime rib was overcooked and dry. The cobbler dessert had mushy apples, as if somebody had just tossed them into a pot and left them out in the sun for three days. The brownies and lemon tarts looked generic and store-bought.\n\nThe service was very good - our server took care of business and was perfectly charming.\n\nSo, this looks like a three star review. Why two? Well, the price was $21. For a dollar more, I could go to the Omni and have a proper brunch with an omelet bar, *real cheese,* fresh fruit, free fresh-squeezed orange juice, farm-raised bacon and sausage, and fresh bread pudding with vanilla creme anglaise. In fact, I think that's exactly what I'll do next time, thank you very much!", "user_id": "ESu6WCQYwQSq0kgB7WHSzQ", "business_id": "rT-iPtIXMKj3dTcl87lbOw"}
{"text": "Just average unfortunately.  The good:  My drink...dark and stormy is going to be my new standby.  The mediocre:  Everything else.\n\nBurger was just so so as were the fries.  The burger was the 704...I honestly can't remember if It even came w/ the pickle chips.  The really really low point of the meal was the desert. The bread pudding was ice cold and hard as a rock. It did come smothered with a caramel sauce, but that couldn't save it.  When asked how our food was I was honest and could tell the waiter was taken aback. I mean seriously, don't ask me if you don't wanna know.  I was polite about it, but said that the dessert was just average.  And questioned why it was cold.  Bread pudding is always warm no?  He also got docked a few points for twice trying to take my plate while I still had more then half of my food left.  He actually removed my girlfriend's drink while she was still working on it!  \n\nIt was nice to have a late night eating option in uptown, but unless someone else wants to go I won't be back. I love that this place is open and serving dinner until 11 or midnight.  That's hard to find in Uptown unless you are at the epicenter.\n\nThe food - well, mixed bag.  The beef short ribs..tasty, but nothing to write home about.\n\nMy girlfriend and I both had the red beans and rice with roasted turkey....now when you hear roasted turkey what do you think?  I'll wait a minute while you ponder this......well what we got was turkey sausage...it was bizarre.  It was sliced and didn't taste bad, but we were confused.  Actually waited several minutes for our waitress to come back to check on us - we asked if we'd gotten the wrong meals..she said no.  Well, it took her so long to come back that by the time we dug in our food was only warm...now that's on us I guess...but, the food was luke warm and bland.  I never reach for hot sauce..and I reached for it here.\n\nThe desserts...now those were on point.  The coconut cake - best i've had beyond Red Rocks.  \n\nSo to recap:\n\nFood - 2 stars\nDesserts - 4 stars\n\nFor an avg of 3 stars. Man, I rarely give out 5 stars...check my history you'll see...well, I'm giving Mimosa 5 stars.  I don't wanna say it's begrudgingly, but it kinda is.  I'm one of those where 'nothing is perfect and there's always room for improvement'  thank goodness I'm not a teacher.  Anywho, I'm going to go for 5 stars instead of 4 simply b/c this was the best meal hands down that I've had in Uptown since I moved here.  \n\nBetter than Chima, 5 Church, Aria, that awful BBQ place I can't remember the name of..the list goes on.\n\nLobster mac and cheese.  Good HUGE hunks of lobster, I only ate a bite or two at the restaurant b/c it was very very creamy, and I have issues with dairy.  I know, why'd I order it...did I mention the huge hunks of lobster?  Seriously there was a whole claw that was still in tact.  I went to town on it when I got home and could verify it wasn't going to upset my stomach.\n\nThe asparagus - yum, it had a very smokey flavor.  It wasn't your standard grilled asparagus.\n\nFinally I had the hush puppies.  This...now let's take a minute here.....it's actually a hollowed out hush puppy with a shrimp filling that is all kinds of yummy.  Oh, it was just the bee's knee's.  I'm totally doing this place a disservice with the description above b/c the hush puppies were on point.  And very unique.  \n\nOh and for dessert, a mini pecan pie with chocolate chips.  Yummm.\n\n\nOur server was also excellent.  It was just myself and a friend and we are quite chatty and so was our server.  So I liked that too.\n\nTo recap - I'm giving them 5 stars...so Mimosa Grill please don't let me down next time I visit you.", "user_id": "bIOg3bUfk_2NfjhdPV6YZg", "business_id": "WuCcv_Dyd_1B_1-4jwK7sQ"}
{"text": "Sunday brunch is a must if you're coming to the Waldhorn. Overall the food is very good and the staff is friendly, but some dishes are better than others. The sausages are amazing, as they should be at any German restaurant. The spaetzle is also great, and the potato salad is the best I've ever had. Some of their meat options are just average though, and I didn't care for the sauerbraten when I've tried it. They have an excellent array of breads and desserts too, which overall are all good to great. Updated after visiting for dinner rather than the brunch buffet.\nThe service was excellent from not only our waitress but the hostesses and other workers who cleared our plates many times and made sure refills were prompt, etc. The accordion player on Friday/Saturday nights is also pretty cool.\nI ordered the jaegerschnitzel, and my girlfriend ordered the sauteed veal. Both were solid choices! The pork in the schnitzel was cooked perfectly, still juicy and also pretty flavorful. The jaeger/hunter sauce was decent, tastes of beef broth and mushrooms. The sauteed veal sauce was similar but with a more meaty flavor, and paired excellently with the meat and spaetzle. My spaetzle didn't have any extra sauce and was just a little plain tasting, but still good. The red cabbage was excellent- just the right balance of sweetness without being too much, but the green beans were really mediocre. They needed some salt and pepper at the least because they had very little flavor. I also got a salad with my order which was decent- I thought it was interesting that they have 2 small bites each of potato salad, carrot salad, orzo salad, and cucumber salad under the lettuce. All 4 were decent but nothing to write home about. Also, the free pretzel rolls brought to the table are really good; they should honestly offer some sandwiches/sliders with them! Mert's isn't necessarily what you'd expect to find in the middle of Uptown, but man the food is excellent! It doesn't lack that casual southern character that makes you feel at home, especially with all the waitstaff in t shirts and jeans. \nMy girlfriend and I came in for lunch, decided on our orders and were pleasantly surprised when the food arrived in just 2-3 minutes. With nearly all of the food made ahead of time cafeteria style with just a quick sear needed to finish off some items and no finishing touches for most others, you might worry that the quality suffers but it did not in our experience! I ordered the salmon cakes with collards and mac & cheese and she got the chopped bbq with green beans and mac & cheese. The salmon cakes were amazing.. no other way to describe it, just order them! The remoulade on the side makes them even better too. The chopped bbq was very good as well. For the sides, the collards and green beans were both tasty choices but the mac & cheese stole the show. So gooey and cheesy, classic baked macaroni & cheese like mom/grandma used to make. The cornbread was good but nothing special. I would have guessed that the salmon patties or mac were what Mert's was famous for rather than the cornbread tbh. \nOverall, the food was fairly inexpensive and came out very quickly, but the taste was amazing and the portions were very large. Add on the fact that the waiters were friendly and that's about all I ask for in a restaurant experience! Went to Mimosa for a business lunch today, and both the service and food were good but not anything over the top amazing.\nI ordered the salmon BLT with sweet potato fries, and as with all of their sandwiches it came with cole slaw. The salmon was cooked to my liking, had good flavor, and my only complaint is that it was slightly too small for the bun and I was left with a decent sized piece of aioli covered bread. The bun was awesome, however, and the salty bacon and aioli sauce complimented the salmon and vegetables very well. Both the lettuce and tomato were very fresh. The sweet potato fries were under-seasoned and not that great, but the cole slaw was some of the best I've ever had! I can see why they offer it with all sandwiches.\nThe service was quality as well, and the manager even promptly fixed a \"messed up\" order when one of my fellow diners said her burger was incorrect for having sauce when she said cheddar and aioli only (but didn't realize aioli is the sauce). All in all decent quality food with pretty friendly service, and they were fairly quick during lunch time which was nice to get us in and out in a short enough duration.", "user_id": "PMBwthnhhwL8Rw8Alis8Ew", "business_id": "2_0P2AmSSFtPgddio0MgYA"}
{"text": "Green's has been here for a long time, and is somewhat of an institution in this city. The hot dogs and burgers are pretty good, with their specialty being \"carolina style\" with chili and slaw. \n\nFood quality is decent, but the big deal here is price. Super-cheap everything is their motto. This place is in the Odell building, around the back near the atm machine. They have a large selection of deli style sandwiches, and you can also get one custom made. \n\nMy personal favorite is the Balboa--a roast beef and horseradish sandwich on rustic bread. The chicken cutlet sandwiches are also good, with the cordon blue style my favorite of those. \n\nLunch is pretty busy, and the ordering process is a bit awkward. You order at one end and give them your name, then everyone sort of congregates around the cash register at the other end while waiting for their name to be called. It works well enough, though, and the wait is usually no more than 5 minutes. \n\nThey close at 3pm. Overall it's a nice place for a quick, quality, deli-style sandwich. Decent food with a laid-back atmosphere. The burgers are very good, and the Brewer's Club is excellent (if you like focaccia). Stay away from the non-standard stuff like their Mexican or novelty sandwiches. I've been disappointed every time I tried to venture into that territory. The main dishes are generally pretty good, with my personal favorites being the Hazelnut Crusted Chicken and the Meatloaf. \n\nIt's a great place to have lunch uptown. When the weather is nice you can sit on the patio and people watch. It's a safe place to bring non-adventurous lunch guests, as the food and atmosphere will have them feeling right at home. Cornbread and Sweet Tea. If that was all you ate here you would already know how good the food can be. The fried chicken and the shrimp and grits are their signature items and always satisfying. You also cannot go wrong with the daily special, particularly if there is \"dressing\" involved. The standard sides are generally good. I really like the macroni and cheese--super creamy and cheesy with baked crusty topping. Just be aware that many of their sides are made with lard, so vegetarians might want to skip this place.\n\nThe service is good, and the food comes out quickly. There can be a long wait if you get there right at noon, so get there early or late if you're planning on lunch at Mert's. Even though the address says Trade St, this place is on the back corner of the Hearst Tower on College and 7th. \n\nThe best thing about this place is that it's open until 4am on the weekends. Don't bother going there between 1:30-3:00, however, since it is generally filled with drunken club goers. If you happen to BE one of those drunken club goers, then you should fit right in. Just don't get too rowdy or the cops will drag you out of line and toss you outside.\n\nI don't bother with the slices or premade calzones anymore...they are ok, but if I want left-overs I'll make them myself. Get a whole pizza here or try the wings (not bad for a pizza place). \n\nThe best time to go here is early evening on a weekend night when the weather is nice. They will usually open up the windows, letting the breeze and sounds of the city flow in. I like to sit by the open window with a friend, a large pizza, and some beers and watch the clubbers roll by on their way to the alley.

{"text": "Oooh I loves me some Mert's! When I worked downtown this place was a regular on my list of favorite lunch spots. You can smell it a block away! Amidst all the new fine dining places Charlotte has to offer is this little gem of home cooked greasy goodness.\n\nIt's hard to recommend any one thing in particular, because I've had almost the entire menu...but I guess my favorite meal had to be the blackened pork chops with some yams, charleston red rice and sauteed squash on the side. It's the kind of lick your lips food that makes you forget it's going to be a long day on the treadmill tomorrow. The fried chicken is also fantastic, as is the shrimp po'boy.\n\nThe owners here are so friendly, and you often see various members of the family working the registers or serving tables. They talk to all the patrons like they're newly inducted members of the family, and make it a very fun, comfortable atmosphere to eat some great food in. We've also used them for catering several times and they stole the from some of Charlotte's biggest names. ****** 4.5 stars *****\n\nOne of the few places where I can safely say that anything you order from the menu will be sure to please. Mimosa is one of downtown Charlotte's original \"great\" restaurants, there long before all the big chain steakhouses decided to take up residence. This place is as safe as it gets, and doesn't break the bank doing it. The decor is very fashionable, and presents a really nice atmosphere without feeling too white tablecloth-like.\n\nI really like the \"upscale Southern\" idea, and not many places in the country can pull it off as well or as consistently as Mimosa does. They specialize in local produce and meats, doing a great job of supporting all the great foods natural to NC. Any time one of my favorite dishes in a restaurant is a beefsteak salad you know they focus on all the details, because it takes a LOT more than you would think to make a REALLY good salad.\n\nWhether you're a Charlotte native, or just visiting the city for business, Mimosa should definitely be on your list of places to try if you want a real taste of Charlotte. It may be easy to go with the big chains like Mortons, Capital Grill, and Ruth's Chris, but your money will be much better spent and go a lot further here! Despite what some people say, the old original Fuel location was on Trade Street, just a bit down from the heart of downtown. The newer location in the Hearst Building and on South Blvd try to reach the heights the old one had, but they fall just a bit short in my opinion. For a long time this was my favorite pizza place in Charlotte (along with Wolfman), because they had that true NY style of thin slices with heaps of greasy meat piled on top. I will second the opinion given below that the single slices heated up are definitely not the way to go, if you are going to come here you have to get a fresh pie for the true experience.\n\nThe non-pizza items are also pretty good, especially the wings. If you like hot stuff as much as I do try them Inferno style, just have plenty of water or beer to cool your mouth down! The garlic knots are also dangerously addictive, and if you're not careful you can easily fill up quickly before your pizza is even ready. Overall I still think Fuel is the place to go if you want some REAL pizza, and I don't think Charlotte has anything to knock it off the throne just yet.", "user_id": "bnVjfyPIsh1dQ8iC1zXNkw", "business_id": "mpDxBBGywUE6GRRKja3sBA"}
{"text": "We went to the Mcninch House last Wednesday for yet another work dinner (no complaints here)!! There was 5 of us in our party and we had this beautiful Old Victorian House to ourselves!! We were the only reservation they had that evening the server insisted they were fully booked the rest of the week though!\n\nIf you have never been or never heard of them before, they ask for you and your party to call in how many courses and what entree choice you would like the day before so that they can plan a menu specifically for your party. We opted for the \"Premiere\" which was the 5 courses for $79 each.\n\nThe house was beautifully decorated with a Christmas tree in each room each with a different theme. Very warm and of course a lot of history! \n\nI chose the Braised Coq au Vin  wrapped in Prosciutto served with couscous and a mushroom reduction...it was dry edible but dry. I only got that so that everyone was eating something different! I should have chosen the Osso Bucco!! Everyone else loved their entrees!!  I really enjoyed everything that they served before it. I just was not blown away by any of it.\n\nI feel that the ambiance was what really won me over and if I were ever to go back it would again be on my Boss' dime!! I like this place a lot! Ive been a few times now and every time i go this place is packed but we get there at the right time cause I've never had to wait!! \n\nIf you like wings the Garlic Honey wings are soooo good!! I would definitely recommend to come here they have good beers a good neighborhood feel and of course good food. The servers are very nice and helpful!! Ok so I finally dined here and lets say disappointing wasn't even the word...if I'm going to be dropping a large sum of money down I want it to be on food that I actually enjoyed!\n\n I went a few weeks ago and we opted for the three course Chef's Tasting menu...well lets just say if these dishes were a reflection of any chef well they truly shouldn't be one right down to the presentations!!\n\n For my first course i had the \"Baked Beans\" as we called it not at all what I expected to get and  barely any Duck Confit in it as it said on the menu very boring and missing lots of flavors so yes they tasted and looked like Baked Beans. Then second course I had the Tomato with goat cheese and peas I had one bite and did not go back for another. The plate was filled with tomato liquid and the goat cheese was running right in it  YUCK is all I have to say!! Then finally our last course MY favorite is Rack of Lamb so of course I'm now anticipating my Lamb I had asked for it to be cooked Rare/Medium Rare just in case they were to over cook it. WELL sure enough it came out Medium Well...Now i would have sent it back but my friend had ordered his steak Medium Well and got his Rare so i didnt want to be that table that sent everything back....\n\nOnly good thing about this place was my company. it is outdated they may want to rethink they're concept AGAIN and possibly add a few woman servers in there to bring some life to this place!! Finally this place was stale like the bread!! We came in last night for a friends birthday and they went out of they're way to make it even more special, not only was the food great but they sent out a champagne toast to start and also a birthday dessert!! \n\nWe started off with the Beef Carpaccio that was so delicious it's now one of my top three in Charlotte!! We also had a Cheese and Meat plate with some Olives also very good the olives were really tasty!! \n\nFor my Entree I had the Rack of Lamb that was served with Artichokes and Fingerling Potatoes it was DELISH!! It was cooked perfectly and seasoned great!! I believe everyone enjoyed they're Entrees also, but I was more concerned with my own to care!! \n\nThe service was great and the manager checked in to see how everything was. We really had a nice time and enjoyed ourselves!! I will be back soon!!", "user_id": "1R6wDvXIzmofopYllK_fpQ", "business_id": "USdRzNk14UdjZWFgBJb0wA"}
{"text": "Great place for a quick lunch...a big part of the reason I enjoy coming here is it is a quick walk from Uptown, and the stroll takes you past some pretty funky, old-timey houses in the 4th ward. \n\nTheir burgers and sammies are all very good. I think I've had every sammich on their menu during one lunch or another, and have never given a single one a thumbs down. London Broil and the Cajun Catfish sammich are the best ones. And after perusing the bar menu, I have had to fight off the urge to order a beer to wash them down with every time as well, due to my presence being required back at work. I enjoy pubs that stock such a wide variety of beers, and this one also includes a rotation of fine ales from another favorite spot of mine, Olde Meck Brewery. I appreciate a bar who keeps it in the QC family! \n\nThis bar is quaint...maybe a little TOO quaint. Being that it is in an old, renovated house, the seating can get cramped at times, especially during peak traffic hours. Service gets bogged down too, both by the level of traffic and unwieldy setup. However, these are nit-picky issues that are easily overlooked when good food and hospitable atmosphere are taken into account. \n\nI hope to come back when I can kick back and imbibe on some good libations! The food alone definitely warrants returning again and again. Good dinner and lunch menu food.  I'd call it authentic Irish pub fare, but then again, I've yet to visit the Emerald Isle, so what the hell do I know?  Other food, namely from the little side sandwich area, is not so good.  The Ri Ra sandwich shop is convenient for most bankers who work uptown, but convenience is all it has going for it.  The sandwiches are overpriced, VERY slim on the stuffings (meat and cheese that is...they will give you all the shredded lettuce your little heart desires...yay).  And to top it off, their seemingly extensive chalkboard of sandwich fixings is paired down by about 50% on any given day, due to them being out of stuff.  Skip the sandwich shop and go to the upstairs balcony for lunch outdoors when it is nice.  You can get their sheperds pie (really good) for the price of one of their sandwich combos (really crappy).\n\nHo-Hum bar experience...during peak times, can get annoyingly hard to get a drink/have a conversation/breath downstairs, but you are in Uptown.  What do you expect?  It's somewhat better than the offerings of the Epicenter, but not by much. Had several sammiches here, and can't complain about one of them.  It's obvious they use quality (Boar's Head, I believe) meats and cheeses in the sammiches, and the menu is a shmorgasboard of creatively constructed sammich creations.  They definitely aren't shy about layering the meats thick, either.  \n\nService has never been overly friendly, and many times outright rude.  I won't let that deter me from enjoying a quality deli sammich though, especially since this place isn't a sit down table side service deli anyways.  If you can put up with rude service for 30 seconds, you're golden! This review is for their lunch sitting...\n\nWow....that one word sums up this place for lunch.  If you would have told me that I would be able to have a sitdown two-course lunch for $12.95 in Uptown, I would have told you you were crazy.  This place proved me wrong.  Considering my burrito, chips, and drink combo from Qudoba or salsaritas pushes $10, Luce was a real breath of fresh air.\n\nA fantastic variety of primi and secondi options, as well as daily specials, and you will be able to return to this same restaurant and never get bored.  The great menu options, along with militarily efficient service, makes this the go-to spot for folks who work in the uptown area and have a limited time for lunch.  \n\nI recommend the authentic ceasar with anchovies and fresh shaved parmesan.  They had a tomato and goat cheese soup as a daily special that was out of this world as well.  The Mare pasta was amazing....tons of fresh seafood throughout this dish.  Most places would serve the pasta itself at $12.95.  Instead, I got fresh bread with a white bean and olive oil aperitif, ceasar salad, and seafood pasta for my money.  Can't beat it!", "user_id": "PxN8HWd32lEu-5d6o3hI-w", "business_id": "ePP0Eqz8JKSbtdt2phiB4A"}
{"text": "Down on the plaza level of the \"jukebox building\" in uptown, Arthurs is a grill and salad place serving lunch and breakfast to corporate types both in the building and connected thru the over street walkway system that connects many other buildings.  \n\nWhile lunch is mainly grilled sandwiches and fries or some rather large salads (some better than others), I have to give this place some credit for a breakfast that is affordable and relatively quick.  Mainly egg sandwiches served on any number of breads and with any number of regular meats, you can't beat the prices here once you are within the \"uptown grid.\"  Under $3 is a little insane, and so post-workout, I like my odds at Arthurs.\n\nIn the morning there is never a wait and the staff looks a little surprised someone stopped in before 8:30 a.m.  But regardless, the stock English muffins toasted perfectly with a little egg to order.  If you want a meat, they've got that too- usually already cooked but placed back on the grill for heating only (no comment here).  They also have a number of Seattle's Best coffees and fountain drinks for those looking to get a caffeine fix in a colder way.  \n\nNothing fancy, nothing unexpected.  Just a quick breakfast that leaves you with some change after a 5-spot.  Try that across the way or somewhere else along the over street walkways- hard, if not impossible to do.  For that, I'm glad to see them sticking around. Italian cuisine that transcends the ordinary, with impeccable service and an ambiance that demands romance make for a great dining experience, especially with your someone special.\n\nThe Mrs. and I strolled in on a Friday night at the start of restaurant week.  Thankfully, \"rush\" is not a concept here and, even from our initial greeting and coat check with the hostess, we were pampered  throughout the evening.  \n\nThe dining room is low lit in the evening, but not dark.  Plaster walls, travertine floors and mostly small tables along the walls.  A small bar sits off to the side, but seemed filled with regulars before the evening's end.  I'll agree with others- this is a place for date night, not a corporate function. \n\nWine list is ample and will cover most palates.  A drink menu holds a small selection of cocktail options.  While you peruse the menu, there is fresh-made bread with a white Italian whole-bean dip that we eventually had to push away lest we spoiled our appetites for the entrees to come.   \n\nThe menu seems to change but you really should listen to the specials of the evening- there is usually a fish of the day and a risotto and pasta of the day that all sounded worthy on our evening.  Our waitress took her time and seemed very knowledgeable about the menu.  While there are a few Italian staples here, like lasagna, there is a noticeable effort to focus on more Tuscan-style offerings that play on fresh vegetables and proteins light on sauce but skillfully chosen to complement the other ingredients.\n\nOn our night, I had pistachio-crusted Salmon alongside a risotto flavored with citrus and cardamom.  It was wonderful.  Salmon was cooked to order and light, while the risotto was rich and savory.  The Mrs. had a veal and risotto dish that was accented with truffle and was equally amazing.\n\nWhile we ate, it seemed all the staff stopped by to ask if we were enjoying our meal and whether we needed anything else.  Glasses never got close to empty and I got the feeling that our disapproval of anything would have resulted in immediate rectification.  In other words, the team-based service approach was seriously spot-on here.  The Italian accents by most staff were a pleasant surprise as well.  Pacing was appropriate and we were comfortable the entire time.  \n\nDessert menu was small, but what we picked out worked very well.  Chocolate lava cake and a pear tarte were both single-sized portions, but just enough to savor and cap off what had already been an exceptional meal.  \n\nBill was promptly delivered but we were never rushed.  Parking validation at the table was nice.  Even upon leaving it seems the floor staff made a point to wish us a good evening.  When the hostess refused our tip for the coat check, it just sealed the deal that these guys take customer serious seriously.  Refreshing.  \n\nLuce not only has some excellence in their kitchen, but it flows out to the floor staff as well.  This was a great choice and is a worthy contender for a romantic night out with one's significant other.", "user_id": "Ul93T_U5jDh1FIIpiiTxuw", "business_id": "_CFgU43jk6pX1cm_Nc1vHw"}
{"text": "They are quick to get your order. Chili is awesome and hearty. A little pricey for what it is though. I love the collection of hot sauces. Hook and ladder is my favorite. Customer service is always awesome. There is someone always at the register and someone cleaning the dining area. Service can be hit or miss. Sometimes it's great and sometimes it sucks. Overall the food is pretty good. Rice pilaf can sometimes be dry. Clam chowder is good! Alfredo can also be dry depending on how much sauce you get. Overall, it's an ok experience. Restaurant is interesting yet confusing. I got lost going back from the bathroom. Lasagna is out of this world. Never ending layers and it seriously melts in your mouth. Enough for two people! We also for a side of meatball. Very huge and delicious! Bread is good too. Came here one morning. There was a line but it wasn't too bad. I got the everything bagel and it was everything you could ask for. The flavor is so good and the bagel wasn't too chewy. There is usually a wait but not too bad. Parking can be a pain since it shares a lot with Red Lobster. Zuppa Toscana is my favorite soup there. You can't go wrong when ordering the chicken scampi or seafood Alfredo. Their stuffed mushrooms is so delicious. Their secret is the tiny pieces of clam in it. Calamari is excellent especially with the Parmesan peppercorn sauce. I seriously crave their pizza puffs!!! They are the best thing ever. Filled with gooey cheese and pepperoni. I haven't tried anything else but if you ever get the chance to go, try the pizza puff!! Me and a friend sat the bar to kill time before going to an event. Bartenders were really nice and helpful. They were really attentive too! Drinks were made just right and really refreshing. My friend wanted a white russian and they told her they didn't have all the ingredients so she got something else. They told her that her first drink was on them due to the issue. She was super pleased with that. \n\nWe were a little hungry so we got a salsa stack. It's only $2 during happy hour. It's homemade chips with pico, beans, corn and fresh avocado. It was so good!! Chips were crispy. The salsa was very fresh and the avocado was perfect. It was the perfect little snack.\n\nTo top off our visit, we saw Muggsy Bogues there too! I got the fried chicken wings. They were large and juicy. Excellent with Texas Pete hot sauce. I got a side item of macaroni. Hubby got the salmon cakes and they were quite small. He said they were good but not worth the price. Server was tentative at first but seriously disappeared for a long time. I noticed the manager staring at us and she finally got out server and I can see her saying something to her about us waiting forever. She finally gave us the check and we waited another 5 minutes to pick it up. Once she picked up our check, we waited another 10 minutes to give us our card back. Service was a little slow. Overall she was friendly and the hostess greeted us outside. Nice atmosphere and food is decent. We  went here for my birthday. My boyfriend surprised me and we had reservations. When we walked in and told him our reservations, the host told me happy birthday. Once we sat down, he immediately gave us each a glass of champagne to celebrate. I thought was really nice of them! We ordered the calamari appetizer and it was good. Light and fluffy. I got the lasagna and it was melt in your mouth good. My boyfriend got the seafood pasta and it was also good. It was so pretty, it was almost too good to eat. After dinner, they brought out a dessert for me with a candle on it. We didn't even ask for it. I thought it was so nice of them that they did those little gestures. Made my birthday extra special.

{"text": "Great authentic NY style pizza. Call ahead or be prepared to wait as there is always a line. Interior could use some renovations, but I usually get it to-go. I finally found a great roast beef sandwich at Matt's! Give me the roast beef with giardiniera and mozzarella all day. Pretty large sandwich; definitely will leave you feeling satisfied. You can have the beef dipped in au jus or on the side. I had mine dipped, which made the bread a bit soggy. Would go on the side next time. \n\nI guess after all the raving about the roast beef I need to try the hot dogs. It will be hard to ignore that sandwich though. Great Chinese in uptown that actually stays open on the weekends! The women who own and manage Soho are very pleasant and welcoming. They recognize regulars and make you feel special. Tip: online ordering available. \n\nI have been to Soho for both work lunches and weekend takeout. I have never had a bad experience. The portions are large and the prices are fair. I usually go with the Kung Pao chicken or Mongolian beef; classic Americanized recipes. I appreciate the plentiful amount of peanuts they use in the Kung Pao. \n\nThey are experts at the lunch rush hour - I can be seated, served, and billed all around 30 minutes. You can tell they have been doing this a while. \n\nKeep it up! I finally got myself to Mert's for dinner the other night after reading all the great reviews. Unfortunately, I left unfulfilled. \n\nThe staff is nice, when you can actually get a hold of them. Be prepared to wait for everything. 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge us as we first walked in. Another 10 minutes for our server to greet us. Another 15 minutes for our food to show. Then another 10 minutes to get our check. This is just too slow for me.\n\nThe food was good. The cornbread held up to my high expectations; buttery with perfect texture. The BBQ pulled pork had a unique flavor. It is an intense, delicious flavor; but after the first few bites the intensity and vinegar becomes a bit overwhelming. My wife's fried chicken was also good. \n\nMert's would be a solid 4 star if the service was more attentive. It deserves another visit. Great business lunch spot! The service is top tier. Our server was friendly, knowledge, and my drink never went below half-full. \n\nLunch menu was full of delicious sounding dishes. The pot roast special sells out right around noon, so get there early if you want to give that a shot. I went with the ancho chicken sandwich; a little sloppy, but delicious. Lot of bold smokey flavor with the creaminess of the aioli. Roasted red pepper, tomato, ancho aioli. \n\nLooking forward to my next visit for dinner! Took the in-laws to Luce before a show at Blumenthal. First thing our server asked was if we were catching a show and what time it was. I was impressed that they asked and ensured we were done in time. \n\nThis is one of the more intimate restaurants uptown. Dim lighting, not many tables, everyone speaking on the softer side. \n\nEverything on the menu sounded great, but I decided to go with the lobster risotto special. Delicious and rich - exactly what I wanted it to be. The rest of the table was pleased with their entr\u00e9e - a couple lasagna dishes and the pollo de parma. \n\nThe bruschetta was one of the better ones I've had. What you would expect - just executed perfectly.", "user_id": "66kGSuUwMTEhnJzDZB5GJg", "business_id": "sJtGRBWYUj013nkFA4Hrdg"}
{"text": "Cute little spot. I live just a few blocks down the street and have never even passed this place- \"hidden gem\" seems to be the term of choice for Alexander Michael's. Not only am I in love with the little parks and the historic Fourth Ward homes, but I really adore places with character- and Alexander Michael's has just that.\n\nAlexander Michael's is dimly lit, very old and bar-looking. We were seated right away but the restaurant soon had a big wait at the door. I can see this is a neighborhood favorite. I'm currently in the \"I dine out too much and cook huge portions / eat as much as I feed my boyfriend\" stage, so I opted against an appetizer and went straight for the blackened catfish. He got the crawfish burrito, which is funny because we noticed that we see cajun/creole EVERYWHERE since our recent New Orleans trip. I swear, I didn't notice anything cajun or creole before NOLA, which is a shame because I adore it so much. Anyway, I tried the burrito (yum) and enjoyed my catfish with saut\u00e9ed vegetables. I'm being healthyish, you know. I'm sure we'll take a stroll back soon. Solid lunch spot. Be sure to sit in the sunny front room- the hostess tried to put me in a booth near the back, but the front is where to be. Large windows overlooking Tryon and the Wells Fargo Plaza. \n\nI had the Carolina Coastal Catch for lunch last week (artisan andouille sausage, jambalaya, baby peppers, green beans, tomato butter) which was delicious. Perfect place for a lunch meeting or to catch up with a friend- or in my case, an impromptu lunch date. I'll be back soon. If you are looking for a somewhat refined business lunch, Luce is the place. It's off the street and in the Hearst building- so walk into the courtyard and you'll find Luce to the left. We went a couple of weeks ago to talk about our trip to New Orleans during lunch- and surprise! Our waitress was from New Orleans. She was super sweet and helpful when filling us in on the top spots we had to see, and thanks to her we learned that the Endymion parade was THE THING to attend during Mardi Gras.\n\nBack to the food. I had the risotto special which was extremely rich and full of seafood- scallops, shrimp, calamari... delish. It was definitely a little much for lunch, so I wasn't able to finish it. Nevertheless, I loved it. As I gazed around the restaurant I spotted nothing but men in suits- which I suppose is to be expected at an Uptown lunch spot. This brings me back to my original point- Luce is a good place for a refined business lunch. Great service and classic atmosphere. Not sure where the hate is coming from. I stopped in for lunch to get a sandwich and charge my phone in between errands and shopping- the waitresses were super nice and friendly, chatted with me about what I bought at Ivy & Leo (apparently they love that boutique as much as I do), and gave me a tip to get the hand cut chips. I've been there twice now and gotten a reuben- which was delicious- both times. No complaints on the bread, the size, or the toppings. It's just a really solid reuben.\n\nI did, however, talk to the new owner- she is also from Michigan and said she bought the place a while ago. I'm sure she is the reason Phil's is turning around! Since I am new to Charlotte I have only experienced the really, really delicious reubens. No complaints here!", "user_id": "iDs0mr1LAb7m3K2L-KcAAA", "business_id": "ePP0Eqz8JKSbtdt2phiB4A"}
{"text": "I think this is one of the most fun places to eat in Charlotte, especially if you can snag the kitchen table. It's a kitschy, tacky, wild and funky place, and the food is huge, plentiful, and delicious. The prices aren't bad, either. \n\nI like the family-style service, although it's easy to over-indulge because everything is so good and so in your face. \n\nIt can get a little busy, so sometimes the servers seem a little overwhelmed. The food can take a while to come out, so although the atmosphere would be great for kids, if your little kidlet is impatient, I would recommend finding somewhere else to go on busy evenings. \n\nThey also offer curbside service if you aren't feeling the atmosphere, so order ahead of time, and they'll bring it out to you. Although the crowd can be a hassle on busy weekend nights, I have to say I'm a fan. Ri Ra is a large, interesting pub with a variety of food and drink options. I'm a sucker for the \"authentic\" Irish pub feeling, with lots of little nooks and crannies to hide away. It does make the crowds less overwhelming. Did I mention I hate big crowds?\n\nThe live music is usually fun, and the service is fast and friendly when you can get to the bar. The servers are good, too, if you get a table. I recommend getting in around dinner time and leaving before the late-night crowd gets too thick. Soho Bistro is great Chinese food at a great price. I used to get take-out from here every couple of weeks when I worked uptown. I make it by there less frequently now, but I have been back a few times. It's worth the trip!\n\nMy favorite lunch special is the Cantonese rice noodles without the chicken and shrimp. It's spicy, and it seems healthy. I'm sure it's cooked in a lot of oil, but it's a healthier option that a lot of the quick lunch alternatives.\n\nIt can get crowded at Soho for lunch, so we usually ordered online or called in and went to pick it up. Parking can be kind of a pain in this area of uptown, so we usually took two people in the car and left one to wait while the other ran inside.\n\nAnother great reason for going to Soho if you're ordering with an office is that it's located pretty close to the PIta Pit and the uptown Fuel. We'd sometimes stop at all three to get something for everybody.\n\nThe prices are good, and the service is quick and friendly. I've never been let down by Soho. Better-than-average bar food with a great atmosphere. It's kind of a standard place to find yourself in nights out uptown...you won't expect to have your socks knocked off by anything, but you also won't have a bad time. It's spacious, too, so it's a great place to start the night off with a big group of friends. It's a decent place to bring kids as well...the menu is pretty diverse in terms of bar food, so it's good for families. \n\nMy favorite part of this spot is the outdoor seating. You don't get a much better outdoor seating experience...you're right in the heart of uptown at one of the busiest intersections. It's fun to sit out there alone and just observe what happens. \n\nIt's also a great venue for events. I attended a work-related party here, and the service was great. We all had a good time. Brixx gets five stars from me for it's fantastic faux cheese. It's a rare and wonderful thing to find a fake cheese that isn't nasty. Not only is the brand Brixx carries not nasty...it's actually quite good. It's convincing enough as a fake cheese that the first time I had it, I asked the server to double-check. I was convinced I'd been cheesed inadvertently. \n\nThe salads are great, and there are lots of good appetizers. I've had some good experiences taking family there, especially when there's a variety of picky eaters coming out. There's a little something for everyone.\n\nIt can get a little busy, which slows down the service, but I haven't had the kind of bad experience that Emilie P. had. I've always found the servers to be friendly and responsive.", "user_id": "8ED8BPCXKXZnGsVMyl5Bhw", "business_id": "SVKC_-gIQFkHElZ6bFsE6g"}

Me, the fine newcomer Elizabeth A. and Heather X., went here on a rainy Friday at 330pm and I left wanting to come back the next day.\n\nThey still were serving lunch at 330 which ROCKED for moi, who is a chronic late luncher since my job lets me sleep in a bit :) Parking in the Hearst Tower lot is the best idea since they validate your ticket, so be sure to bring it in with you!\n\nA smaller place than I expected, there's a great, mellow vibe here. The lights that hang over the tables are beautifully warm with medium colored wood and soft white bulbs inside frosted glass. While empty when we arrived, I can definitely see this place being crowded at lunchtime between 1130-130 so heads up on that! Calling it in seemed to be a pretty good option and one that was utilized alot while we were there!\n\nStarting off with crab ragoons and asian fresh rolls, we shared and IMO the crab ragoons really shone about and beyond. The fresh rolls were good, but I wasn't a fan of the sauce they came with (reminded me of an Indian fig sort of thick sauce) and the duck sauce wasn't meshing well with it either.\n\nI ordered the General Tofu and while I feel like I'm piggy-backing onto Elizabeth's review, it was true that the tofu was PERFECT. I mean, HOLYYYY MOTHER THIS IS PERFECT. From the fry (not overly but not soggy under), to the sauce (I asked for it extra spicy, and they delivered!), to the picking of your own veggie (I choose brocoli which came out not mushy, not stiff but the almost unreachable middle ground) and the delish spring roll (something is added to this that is not in most - no clue what but it makes it hearty but still light).\n\nThe service was attentive, kind and accommodating, the space was intimate yet casual and the food was stellar. That's a WIN WIN WIN in my book! Enjoy! Brixx, it's time I came clean. I'm using you. You're just somewhere I go when I'm desperate and it's late at night. Your BOGO pizza and apps are a good deal, and let's face it - you're close to me. But I just want you to know that when Charlotte has more places open late Mon-Thur, I WILL start going to those places and I will not miss you. So let's just keep our thing at what it is right now, but please don't leave your menu on my take out box again, OK?", "user_id": "kSV2NJ2jsj5qssaF6ANqew", "business_id": "2_0P2AmSSFtPgddio0MgYA"}
{"text": "I've been coming to China Buffet for approximately 10 years now. When I first moved to Pineville in 2001 this was just somewhere close to eat cheaply. At that time they did not have the sushi chef.\n\nThe Chinese Buffet:\nNothing to write home about. Nothing here is truly worth mentioning. Just your standard Chinese buffet fare mostly covered i thick, syroupy sauces and probably very unhealthy. Nothing is particularly good but nothing is particularly bad either.\n\nThe Sushi Buffet:\nThis is why you want to come here (unless you're a sushi snob because no matter what you''re just not gonna be happy)! All you can eat sushi for around $10 (which also includes the Chinese buffet portion but let's pretend it doesn't for the heck of it). This is pretty unbeatable given that the sushi is freshly made throughout the day. Yes, I do agree that the presentation plates could be wiped off between servings on the fried pieces with heavy sauces but not all their offering has tick coatings of sauces. So, in my case, I don't eat those. I like them... but I chose to eat the ones that are not covered in thick sauces and look more presentable.\n\nTony, the sushi chef (I don't know the other guys'  name but thank god he's rarely if ever there) is really cool. He's very engaging with his customers, he remembers your name and your family. He greets you openly and warmly and is always ready to offer suggestions on new things to try. Remember to tip him well even if you don't touch the Chinese food (I usually don't, except for the egg drop soup)\n\nThe staff is very serviceable and are constantly refilling your glass and cleaning your table. They speak very little English but enough to understand what you want should you be the pesky customer who needs everything customized in a buffet style restaurant. Unfortunately, as someone else say, they do have the very rude tendency of always getting in the way and NEVER giving the customer the right of way. They cut in front of you and make you stop or go around them instead of them doing so for the customer. This is what knocked one star.\n\nObviously the staff has changed through the years. I remember a couple of waitresses throughout the years that were really nice and helpful. They got to know my little girls and tried teaching them how to eat with chop sticks. So, my, and Becky's, kids all love it here. This is definitely a good place to take children since they can pretty much try a bunch of things without worrying about not liking it (This is, after all, where my, at the time, 5 year old fell in love with Ikura). The owner, although in all the time I've been going has never once acknowledged that I am a regular (sometimes twice to three times a month) regular, seems rather unfriendly and, actually, kinda sour. I don't know if he is or not... but he doesn't seem very welcoming, warm or friendly. Not that it bothers me, I don't care, I'm there to eat... but I noticed it.\n\nThe decor is a mix of traditional chinese with some modern lighting and tacky foreign cluelessness (yes, I just made all that up but when you see it it'll make sense). And the place is very clean except for the ice cream machine which doesn't get enough TLC from the staff.\n\nThis is a great place to come and have lunch once in a while if you work in the area or have kids who want to try Chinese or have sushi lovers (not snobs) who want good sushi for free. But this is not the type of place that you will be making special trips to visit. Try to avoid dinner as it gets rather expensive without any appreciable additions to the buffet. Most of the time I've been to Brixx is because they're having some sort of craft beer event. Yesterday I had a couple of meetings in the downtown area about an hour apart so I decided to stop by and have a couple of beers and a pizza.\n\nThe place was deserted but what do you expect for 2pm on a Thursday. My waitress was friendly and attentive. My food came out fast and my beers were poured cold. That visit was good.\n\nIn previous visits we've had some major issues with our waitstaff not having even the most remote clue about craft beer. It's always been a pet peeve of mine that craft beer venues do not hire people who know what the heck it is they're serving.\n\nThis is the biggest problem I have with Brixx. Aside from that the food is pretty good and the atmosphere is your typical downtown crowd. On weekends it gets incredibly and uncomfortably packed.\n\nI also think it is totally awesome of them to be involve din RAIN's Amazing Bar Crawl which got the the 4th star in my book.\n\nOverall you won't be disappointed. Pretty solid place to hang out, eat some good pizza and drink some good beer.", "user_id": "uQpNNgvjrQxjn26YI9LLyQ", "business_id": "5p3Tqyp19UowO0-dAFvxMw"}
{"text": "This is a great old gem in the historic 4th Ward of Uptown. Everything here is great, and the prices are even better! \n\nI've had the chance to have several menu items here, each being just as good as the last. \n\n-The London Broil is served with perfectly  cooked/marinated flank stead. Of course to have to get it with the peppers & onions to really make it what it should be. \n-The Ruben is a good size, and the Dijon mustard they thrown on there makes it a little different than what you're used to. It surprised me as I didn't even read the description on the menu when I ordered it. \n-the quinoa veggie black bean burger is superb. This is a must try for everyone who loves any sort of veggie burgers --- it's served on fresh pita bread, wowza!\n-crab soup is delicious as a starter for all you seafood lovers out there. \n\n\nBonus: All of their bread is locally sourced from the outstanding Nova's Bakery in Plaza Midwood! Ri Ra's is right outside of my office ... so my colleagues and I frequent it a few times a month. Their burgers are delicious ... you can't go wrong with the 704, Hot & Smoky, or Guinness BBQ.  Huge burger ... and the side portion is huge too. I always get the onion rings .. one word: DYNAMITE.  A great place to come for lunch, or to come and catch a game on TV.  Very busy bar scene at night also, starting around 10:30/11 Can't say enough good things about the few food items I've had hear. Appetizer: definitely go with the chicken nachos. HUGE (easily share between 4+ people) and great taste/toppings. My absolute favorite entree is the Lobster & Shrimp Enchiladas. I'm not a fan of black beans, so I sub out the black beans for Mac & Cheese. I consider myself a connoisseur of mac'n cheese ... and this is definitely top 5 of any restaurant I've been too.  Do yourself a favor and stop in here! Love Salsarita's! 2-taco combo every time I go ... 2 tacos, chips & salsa and a drink for $6.50. Their queso is delicious ... and they have shrimp as an option for your tacos. Shrimp & Queso?!? TAKE THAT CHIPOTLE! Coming from Ohio, I'd never had a Jersey Mike's sub before moving to Charlotte. I go almost every Tuesday for lunch when they do any regular sub, chips, and a drink for $6.49. Great deal and ever better sub! You cannot go wrong with the traditional Italian or club sub  .... gotta have it Mike's Way! Staff is always friendly and very quick to make the subs. On my most recent visit to Brixx, I decided to give the Thai Chicken Salad a try. It sounded good, but I had reservations about the limited toppings it was listed to have. When I order a salad, I like a big variety of ingredients, otherwise it's just something I could make at home, so what's the point ... ya know? This salad only had chicken, goat cheese, roasted red peppers & pistachios (random, but delicious nonetheless). Needless to say, when the food came, I wished I had listened to myself. The ingredients had a good flavor, and their was plenty of chicken in it, but it was just such a boring salad. Usually you get carrots, cabbage, onion ... tons of stuff in a thai salad.  This wouldn't be my first choice by any means.\n\nService was about average, nothing exceptional going on in that department. Their pizza is 100000x better than a salad, so I'd definitely go with the extra calories on this one.", "user_id": "Al_lV54KFnRgAqDO-qVIuw", "business_id": "ePP0Eqz8JKSbtdt2phiB4A"}
{"text": "I did give this 4 stars, but I'm updating my review after a recent visit. The service is SLOW! We came here twice before on a Sunday. There is no waiting and we got seated right away. Thinking since they weren't so packed, that the service would be better. Not. Every time we have came here when they are busy service has been great, but when they are slow they ARE slow. Maybe not enough motivation for the staff? Don't know what's up.... However cheddar bay biscuits make life better :-)\n\n--------\nOriginal review posted September 2015 \n\nMy husband and I came here last night for all you can eat shrimp around 6:30pm. The wait for 2 was an hour n a half long so we decided to eat at the bar (no matter what time, this location always has a wait). I usually don't like eating at the bar, but our bartenders were awesome! Before we even ordered we were given the cheesy bay biscuits and waters. Score! We both ordered the all you can eat shrimp and our order came out in less than 15 minutes. We were also provided drink refills no questions asked, which was great because I hate when you sit there with an empty glass and they don't refill it without you asking. \n\nIn addition, there were 2 other couples next to us enjoying all you can eat shrimp. Eventually the bartenders caught on and starting bringing out shrimp by the dozen. Without even ordering another round they would present different shrimp options to us. It truly was all you can eat shrimp!!! It started to become humorous because at one point they brought out more shrimp, but we were all so full and no one wanted it. Needless to say we left full and with boxes of extra shrimp to take home. \n\nThe only reason why I gave this 4 stars over 5 is because we did have slow service once in the dining room, but the food was delicious so no complaints from the food category. I always forget about Jersey Mikes in uptown because it's not in the over street mall area. This location is found in the Citizen bank building. It's super busy on Tuesdays because they run their $6.59 lunch special (regular sub, chips & drink), but the service has always been super fast. \n\nMy go to choice the the #7- turkey and cheese all the way with banana peppers added. Wondering what 'all the way' means? Well it's lettuce, onion, tomato, pepper, salt, oil,vinegar and special seasoning. It tastes awesome. They also have a bunch of different sandwiches to pick from. \n\nAdditionally, Jersey Mike's doesn't skimp on the toppings. Every time I've been here they load up the meat. There's a good amount on your sub so you won't leave disappointed. I FINALLY had a chance to try Brixx pizza! My husband and I came here before a Hornets game to get a bite to eat. We decided to order two pizzas. There pizzas are meant to be personalized sized, but they are pretty big! Well worth the $10. The pizza is made from a brick oven so it came out super fast. The crust was light and crispy- cooked perfectly. \n\nWe both ordered pizza and we were able to split pizzas half n half so we eventually were able to try 4 different flavors! Btw they have about 20\nPizza options for you to pick from. Here were our choices: \n\nPear and Gorgonzola: very unique. I liked this pizza, but would never order a full pizza of it. The nuts on the pizza kinda threw me off however, If you like something different I would recommend this. \n\nRosemary chicken: very refreshing with the Rosemary. The pizza also included mushrooms and onions. \n\nMeatball: oh my! The meatballs were awesome! \n\nJerk chicken: this was my favorite flavor. It was spicy, but the pineapple on the pizza counteracted it. I would order this pizza again!  \n\nOverall we had a good experience at Brixx and I would go there again. I love the variety of pizzas they have, plus they offer salads and sandwiches too!", "user_id": "xrPtS7uo5r_VJB5g3pDzTg", "business_id": "BO0zz8gort7o-6KuecIv3Q"}
{"text": "I have visited the Charlotte Ri Ra several times when I have been in Charlotte on business and have always enjoyed myself. Yeah, it's loud, crowed and very smoky (especially for a smoke-free Californian), but that's what makes it a Pub. When traveling on business I often have to find placed where I won't feel awkward dining alone, and a lively Pub always keeps me from sticking out. This evening I just had the Guinness BBQ burger, a few pints of the dark stuff and I stayed for the acoustic music.... I'll be back. I recently had lunch with a colleague at Ratcliffe on the Green. It a business lunch and I usually don't note things like the building and decor, but in this case it was unavoidable. The decor and service were impeccable. The service had that nice balance of friendliness and professionalism. They were always available and addressed out needs, but I never saw them hovering about. My colleague is a regular there, so we were greeted warmly and our greeter (who happened to also be an active local judge???) shared with us some stories from his recent trip to Paris. My meal started with a cream of tomato soup, that was much thicker than I had anticipated, but still very tasty. Lunch was a Carolina Crab Cake Salad which was fabulous. Nice view of downtown Charlotte outside our window table from which we were able to watch a rain storm pass, thankfully, before heading back to work. On business in Charlotte, walking around downtown in muggy weather with colleagues looking for a place for lunch. The original destination was the French Quarter, but when I mentioned that I had been there before (and enjoyed it) they insisted on going somewhere else. As we stopped there was Brevard Court Sundries so that was it. Although there is a street level entrance the restaurant is upstairs, and up we went. Very busy place. Everything was no-nonsense which is actually great for a quick lunch. Quick service, lots of water, and quick delivery of our orders, Cajun blackened chicken and shrimp over pasta for me. More water a quick delivery of the bill and we were on our way. I was last the the Mimosa Grill a few weeks ago while visiting Charlotte on business. It was pouring outside, so to was very nice to be out of the rain and be immediately greeted by the welcoming decor. We were quickly seated by our very pleasant host and our waitress briefed us on the specials for the evening. I asked for a recommendation on a cheese selection her choice of a local goat cheese was fabulous. For the entree I chose the New York Strip Pepper Steak and it was prepared perfectly. A glass of Beringer Reserve Cabernet went very well with the meal. I have been to the Mimosa Grill a few other times in the past and have always been pleased with the entire evening, and this was no exception. Last week I was in Charlotte on business and a colleague and I chose the Capital Grille for our after work dinner location. As we approached the spot it was very quiet outside so we weren't sure if this was going to work out, but as soon as we stepped inside the energy hit us. The service was very prompt, friendly, and professional. I ordered the Cajun rubbed Delmonico steak and it was wonderful. Sauteed mushrooms as a side and a 2005 Cakebread Cabernet completed the meal. Since the place was unknown to us the unexpected pleasant surprise of the place added to the overall experience.", "user_id": "o4rhsNj1X8pynIX-zVJeqw", "business_id": "WuCcv_Dyd_1B_1-4jwK7sQ"}
{"text": "Of course I cant afford a real meal here but to feel part of the ELITE I go for the wine tastings!!!  They are almost every other Monday, sometimes they will have them outside but usually they are inside their spectacular dining rooms.  Yes, the house is stunning and historic if you like antiques and victorian style decor.  The wine tastings are $20 bucks per person and include usually 7 or so wines and heavy apps.  You can wander throughout the downstairs or on the peaceful porch with your wine.  It is the perfect Monday happy hour!  Love you McNinch!!!  :-D Fantastic date place!!!  This little restaurant has fantastic apps and dinners.  My favorites are the Shrimp Marsala or the What It Is.  The crab soup is excellent also.  When I am there for dinner I always get a half and half with my meal.  But if you are just going for lunch get the chicken quesadillas - excellent.  Ladies!  Watch out for the pole!  Then take a walk around the beautiful Fourth Ward! This place blows chunks.  I would have given it just one star but the waitresses are fab and cute.  The whole place smells like it has been through a flood and instead of getting the place cleaned properly they spent the insurance money on new cars.  \n\nI have had the wings here..blah and the veggies are gross with brown tips on the celery.  Yuck.  It is a huge space and has cool giant tvs so if I was just here to watch the game and drink it would be okey dokey.  There are a ton of places to watch the game though that have great food...sigh.... IMHO Salsarita's chicken is nothing compared to Chipotle's.  That aside though I do love the fact that I can get fresh cilantro at Salsaritas!  The breakfasts here are my favorite since I hate normal breakfast food.  We do a lot of work breakfasts here and it is the one place everyone can agree on.  They have a breakfast quesadilla with eggs and potatoes and you can get whatever you want on it - great prices and super friendly staff! This place is stuck between two and three stars for me  so I bumped it up to 3 only because it really is a gorgeous old-school interior.  The food is fantastic....it is right by my office or I wouldn't pop in so much.  Love lunch and dinner here....I cant get over the overpriced wine though.  $16 bucks for a glass of Conundrum?  When I buy A BOTTLE OF IT at Total Wine for $19-22?  Yes this bitch has felt the need to indulge after a hard day at work but seriously????  This is not a frequent splurge.\n\nThe service is impeccable and the lunch and dinner menus are top rate.  I will of course be back (unless my office gets moved too far away lol).  You are A-OK my pricey little Mimosa! Super fast service!!!  I love all the Brixx locations and this one is no exception.  Yes it is a little not-so-glamorous to have the patio view of a parking garage and street but it is so convenient since it is right on 6th street Uptown.  \n\nI have never had a bad thing on the menu - the Pesto Chicken Salad is what I had here recently and it was delish!!!  Candied walnuts really make the difference.  Super fresh fruit on the salad - it was so much I couldnt finish it all!  Great prices and awesome service!\n\nPark at the 7th Street station and they will validate you!!! The Capital Grille is fantastic!  A bit of a pretentious crowd in the bar area but that's what you would expect....  Filet cooked rare with lobster macaroni on the side is my ideal 'last meal' before I die.  Service is great except one time we got a young waiter here that thought that since we were a little young that we wanted to be spoken to with 'true dat..and word'.

{"text": "Review for drinks only\n\nStopped in on Saturday before dinner across the street.  Was sort of taken aback by 2 customers seated on the patio.  Both guys had on sports jerseys, jean shorts, or jorts if you will, and were seriously blinged out.  Just seemed so out of place with everyone around them.  \n\nWe sat at a table in the bar area and the bartender came over with some cocktail menus and got us all waters right away.  I had the grapefruit buck and it was sooo delicious and refreshing.  I believe it was gin, campari, ruby red grapefruit juice and maybe something else, served w/a grapefruit slice.  I loved it.  Tried someone else's drink and wasn't a fan so was def happy with my choice.\n\nHad to run to make our reservation so it was just the one round.  Wasn't cheap for 3 cocktails and a beer it was $46 I believe.  But it was a nice atmoshpere and we saw they are running for prix fixe in October so we might stop in for dinner before Chelsea Handler at TW. Stopped in for a quick drink after An Evening with David Sedaris and I wanted something sweet so I planned on getting dessert.  I had the grapefruit buck to drink again, its so yummy!  The bartender told me the cheesecake or chocolate hazelnut cake were the best options and I was craving chocolate so I went with the latter.  Umm I should have taken a pic, this \"piece\" of cake was as big as my head!!  I knew I wouldn't finish it but I got my chocolate fix and pushed it aside.  It was good but I could have done w/o the hazelnut in this case.\n\nBartender was very nice, but I found it odd she kept calling me dear, considering she looked to be around the same age as me it seemed strange! I have now been here for dinner twice  and can fully commit to the 5 star rating!  In December a friend brought my sister and I here for our Xmas present.  LeeAnn D's review summs up that experience perfectly except she left out the bread basket.  I swear I could have been happy just sitting there eating bread all night, it was such a great selection!\n\nThe last time I was here was for restaurant week.  As a thank you for the meal in Dec, the manager gave my friend a $50 gift card for a return visit that had to be used by beginning of Feb, so we decided to eat here again.  Mixed green salad was good, dressing on the side though otherwise it drowns the lettuce.  Porcini rubbed tournedos of beef were excellent, and I actually couldn't finish both.  The mashed potatos were probably the best I have ever had anywhere.  You just knew there was 3 sticks of butter and a ton of heavy cream in there, but they were simply amazing.  The creamed spinach however, tasted like soap, bleh.  Our server replaced them when we told her they tasted funny, but the 2nd batch just had a milder soapy flavor.  Still this was not enough to ruin an otherwise perfect meal.  Creme brulee to finish up and the chocolate espresso cake to go since my friend doesn't care for dessert, was a great ending to the meal.\n\nWith the gift card and the restaurant week pricing it made this meal with 4 glasses of wine and 2 cocktail about $43 pre tip.  Tip on the pre discounted amount and we still walked away paying $60 for a meal that could have been A LOT more expensive.

{"text": "Rock Bottom probably has one of the best locations in uptown. Right on Tryon St. with a large dining area and excellent patio for people watching or watching the cars go by.\n\nI don't remember what I ordered I think it was some sort of BBQ chicken and ribs. The food was pretty average, I didn't get to try the beer but I hear it's quite excellent. It's not that the food is bad, in fact I quite enjoyed my time here, but the selections available and food that came out were just not quite memorable. Maybe I would even call it boring.\n\nI'd come just for the great atmosphere here. When you go to the bathroom you can see all the behind the scenes brewing behind a large glass window! The parking is free too which is nice, more to spend on food! This place somehow gets a lot of people coming for the food. Personally though I have never eaten here this review goes over the hookah here which is awesome!\n\nYou can't smoke hookah outside so you'll usually be seated outside on the small patio, or upstairs on the 2nd floor. There's tons of flavors to choose from ranging from $10-15 which is a terrific value considering how long it lasts! The scenery around here isn't exactly the greatest even though it is downtown. Last time I was seated on the front patio and watching the cars go past and wondering how some people's eardrums weren't blown out by their bass we got pestered by the local homeless guy for some change. I think his name was Teddy, and he gave us a dance until the manager came outside and chased him off.\n\nI'd probably suggest eating somewhere else and just coming here for the hookah. The menu looks positively bland, but the hookah is top notch, and the waiters are super friendly and even give me water and refill it regularly. I like that, also you should get the honeydew hookah. It's fabulous! I'm sorry Capital Grille I really wanted to give you four stars but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. Your dining room is very nice and your staff so very polite and accommodating as saints.\n\nI'll echo what Adam R. said and say that steakhouses are not usually my dining preference when choosing a place to eat at but I had really enjoyed the good eats at the Capital Grille Generous Pour event recently I decided to give it a shot. Warmly greeted at the door and reservations confirmed even though we had arrived a bit earlier than expected, their hospitality is as good as ever. The problem is I didn't exactly enjoy my meal as much as I would have hoped even though I still had a good time surrounded by friends and family.\n\nAppetizers came out in a very timely manner once menu choices were made. I chose clam chowder based on a recommendation. Well it wasn't amazing but it wasn't bad either, a well made clam chowder is one of my favorite things to eat so this was a bit of a let down. My entree a Kona crusted dry aged sirloin was perfectly cooked and served with a nice composite shallot butter how old school! The only problem is that they didn't cook all the steaks as well as mine. One person had ordered a medium steak and it came out well done and extremely charred (It was comped when she mentioned it and the waiter and manager were very sorry and concerned about this so I'll have to thumbs up them for handling a situation so graciously). The shallot butter though didn't really add anything to the dish for me and the steak wasn't so flavorful that it could stand on it's own. The best part of the meal? Dessert! But not my dessert, I was talked up on the ice cream and decided to order it instead of creme brulee. Well that was a major mistake on my part. My whole meal had been heavy and if I had went with sorbet I might have been able to finish it, but I decided on ice cream. Peanut butter, chocolate, and vanilla ice cream was just too much to handle for me and I called it quits after a spoonful of each. The creme brulee was still as addictive as ever from what I tried on someone's plate though!\n\nI would go back here just for the service alone. It's really nice to be treated like they really care about your visit. It might be a while before I head back though but cheers Capital Grille!", "user_id": "6n1Gb-yHpw4ke0oSAFOOnQ", "business_id": "ym9QwkmB5ZKTyj7q5huTDw"}
{"text": "Sunday morning the cornbread hits the spot.  The rest of the meal, food and service, was mediocre at best. To tell the truth, the service ran along the lines of pretty poor. We sat outside and the tables around us were annoyed with the bad service too. Actually the woman at the table of three directly across from us kept telling customers to \"go away\" when they came dine. She also was served the wrong meal but no one ever came back to check on her.\n\nWe started the meal with the fried green tomatoes - Fresh green tomatoes battered in a herb and flour blend, lightly fried to perfection and served with our own remoulade sauce - it was served with our cornbread and the server said she would return with side plates but never did. She never refilled our drinks either. The fried green tomatoes had a very heavy batter on them. It was hard to find \"tomatoes\" in the dish. I would resist trying this appetizer.\n\nWe waited a long time for our main course which is why it was probably cold when it arrived at our table. Scott had the special beef tip omelet with potatoes. He had asked for wheat toast but we were told they had none and they would bring white. They never bought the toast or asked if his meal was good. I tried the Mert's famous salmon cakes. These were dry and cold and my sides the macaroni & cheese - tasty - and okra & tomatoes - greasy? - were also suffering from being left sitting waiting for someone to bring them to our table. \n\nAfter finally chasing someone down inside we got our check. With all the options in the neighborhood to try we probably won't add this to our list of great places to dine. Lots happening in downtown Charlotte St. Patrick's weekend, and this place was packed.  The hostess told us we could not sit outside but we could sit by the window \"which is the same thing\" - huh? \n\nGreat beer selection and a very good Greek salad. The wild mushroom and arugula pizza was \"missing\" something.  The crust was chewy and not tough but the toppings were bland and I didn't see a wild mushroom anywhere on the plate (just white button). The server charged us for the wrong check. 24 hours later both charges are still on my Amex.  Just an average lunch stop. Disappointing ... I really enjoy The Capital Grill most times and this experience left a poor taste for the Charlotte location. Our service and the food was, at best, two-star. I know I did not have the steak but typically I can count on this chain to deliver a good meal - if not great (my last visit in Downers Grove, IL in December was fabulous).\n\nWhen we were told we could not get a table for an hour we decided to sit at the bar.  After about 15 minutes the host said he could seat us - we should have been suspicious at this point. We went outside to our table that had trash and leaves around the edges of the patio (hey, wait they didn't just blow there last night).  Our tablecloth had stains and spots on the silverware. \n\nIt took a good 15-20 minutes for our server to come take an order after bread and water were dropped. We asked to start with the fresh mozzarella, tomato, and basil with 12-year aged balsamic. When it arrived it was two neat stacks on one plate and one empty plate. When we asked the server why it was not split his response was \"we can't split this salad.\" Ok - not as if we asked to split an escargot- the salad was almost perfectly portioned for two. Not to bother we just shared. The sliced tomatoes were mealy and flavorless and only one leaf of basil per stack. There was a nice marinated grape tomato as a garnish but I didn't pay for a tasty garnish. \n\nThe main course we tried the grouper special. I've had better. The grouper was ok (notice the theme) but the shrimp that came with the special was overlooked and tough. Our sides - saut\u00e9ed spinach and the wild mushrooms were good. We ordered a 1/2 order of both which is just perfect for two people. My only comment is we pulled eight whole cloves of garlic out of the spinach before eating it. Vampires beware ,,,\n\nOur drinks were never tended too and the front server never bothered to follow up on the salad. I hope everyone inside had a better experience.", "user_id": "sQUNOD9vC8IHCh9XX82phw", "business_id": "mpDxBBGywUE6GRRKja3sBA"}
{"text": "We've been living in Charlotte for a year now, and we've been to quite a few restaurants in our time. However, while I have found that perfect BBQ joint I dreamed of, I had not yet happened across the quintessential place for good ol' Southern cooking...in particular fried chicken. Well, that is now a thing of the past, for I have found Merts.\n\nYou could tell just from walking inside that it was going to be a great Southern food experience. The interior of the restaurant is colorful and eye-catching, and the art and decor screams Southern. The interior was full to capacity, but we were able to snag a table outside. The outdoor area is a mixed bag. While it's nowhere near as crowded as inside (with only four tables or so) the Charlotte pedestrians take it upon themselves to walk through the outdoor area. It was a bit disruptive to be eating a nice meal while people constantly walked right against your table. \n\nI wasn't a fan of the beer list since Merts does not carry any drafts, so I stuck with unsweet tea. After placing our orders the server came over with a small loaf of cornbread for each of us. This cornbread was spot on for me! Not gritty, a little sweet and extremely crumbly. You could tell it was fresh from the oven, and that made it super awesome!\n\nFor dinner I ordered the beef ribs and leg quarter fried chicken combo. I wasn't crazy about the ribs themselves, as they were a bit tough and chunks of bone kept flaking off. I did enjoy the sauce, as it was a sweet and tangy sauce and not vinegary. Now the chicken was THE BOMB! I've been searching for fried chicken down here, and have been disappointed time and again. So far I am confident to say that Merts has the best fried chicken (though I haven't made it over to Price's yet, so don't jump on me for that yet.) The battered skin was light and crisp, and not greasy. The interior was that moist and juicy you expect from fried chicken. I was in heaven scoffing that chicken down, and I wish I had more right now! \n\nThe miss' ordered the catfish and fried chicken breast combo, and that was also pretty dang awesome. The catfish was a huge filet just plopped on the plate. The meat came right off and was so light and tasty. The batter was also perfect, with not too much that didn't take away from the soft flavor of the fish. They serve it with this spicy sauce that was a good compliment to the fish. The chicken breast was just as good as my leg. Even the white meat stayed juicy and tender! The miss' didn't eat too much of it after filling up on the fish, so there are plenty of chicken leftovers in my future!\n\nThe other thing that Merts does damn good is sides. One problem I've had at BBQ and other places down here is that the meats are perfect, yet the sides are extremely lacking. Merts has some of the best dang sides money can buy. We both ordered the mac & cheese and it was simply the best I've had down here. Some places I've been to make it watery or oily or just not flavored right, but Merts had it all. It was a firm consistency with a great cheesy flavor, and the cheese crust on top was awesome. I also tried black eyed peas for the first time and loved them. They were cooked perfectly and were served in this kind of gravy that was also tasty. The miss' ordered the collard greens and I have to say that I liked those too. I'm generally not a fan of collards as they are bitter, but these were cooked in such a way that the bitterness was taken down a notch or two. They had some citrus flavoring to them that helped tone it down and added a different level of flavor to. All in all, the sides kicked butt! Unfortunately we were so stuffed from this massive meal that we did not stick around for dessert.\n\nI have to say, when I think home cooked Southern fare, I will always associate it with Merts. They can fry up some mean chicken and fish, and their sides and veggies are top notch. It's a busy place but it is definitely worth the trip. I've been dying to come here to get my steak on, but the menu prices are downright daunting! This time around we made reservations to partake in their Restaurant Week menu, and it is the most affordable way to experience one of the better restaurants in the area.\n\nThe Capital Grill may be a chain, but it definitely doesn't feel like it. From the interior decor to the service to the actual food, everything screams upscale fancy-smancy...not something that is usually associated with a chain. We made reservations (highly recommended) and were seated almost immediately.\n\nOur server was very friendly and brutally honest. I guess she was forced to try to upsell us a $17 glass of wine but then told us how ridiculous it is and we shouldn't bother with it. When we did choose a bottle of wine she detoured us to a different bottle that was the same price but was more well-received. I'm glad we went with her recommendation because it ended up being an awesome bottle that we would have overlooked otherwise. \n\nFor the first course of the Restaurant Week menu I had the New England Clam Chowder. I am a sucker for clam chowda and this stuff was great. It wasn't overly heavy with cream and had a ridiculous amount of succulent clam chunks in it. This chowda definitely didn't skimp on the seafood, and the clams, potatoes and bacon were all melded nicely for some of the best I've had in awhile. The missus got the field green salad which was very nice, and came with an excellent champagne dressing that worked very well with the veggies. I was almost a little jealous of her salad, but I had chowder in front of me, so that feeling didn't last long.\n\nThe Restaurant Week menu was decent for entrees, with a few steak options as well as a chicken and salmon. I ordered the 14oz bone-in sirloin and this was one of the most magnificent steaks I've had in the Queen City. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare just as I ordered it, and it was a tender, juicy, tasty steak with an excellent beef flavor. It was such a huge steak that I only ate half and saved the rest for a leftover dinner the next night! \n\nThe missus had the Citrus Glazed Seared Salmon. It was a very nice piece of salmon that wasn't overpowering, and the glaze was really tasty. Her plate also came with some roasted asparagus that were cooked perfectly and had a nice sauce drizzled on top. Our table was also served shared side dishes of mashed potatoes and green beans. The potatoes were crazy rich, creamy and delicious, and there were still a few nice lumps mixed within the majority of the velvety mass, making these potatoes freaking awesome. The green beans were also tasty, and were tossed with tomatoes to give it a little extra pop.\n\nFor dessert we both shared the Cheesecake and Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake. The cheesecake was actually more like a mousse, and so it was light as opposed to dense. It tasted wonderful and the top is caramelized to give it a crisp bite. It was served alongside a few berries and strawberry glaze, which made one delicious mouthful. The chocolate cake was just as good, if not slightly better. The espresso flavor is very light so if you're not a coffee fan don't be afraid to give this a whirl. The consistency of the cake was more like a chewy fudge, making it extremely decadent. \n\nThe Capital Grill is the place to go, so long as you have to cash. The food is all excellent and I would love to go back and try some other stuff out. The ambiance, service and food all scream swank, and it definitely feels like it warrants the extravagant price tag.", "user_id": "iXpKKeeiXjBncJyDWbfhxw", "business_id": "mpDxBBGywUE6GRRKja3sBA"}
{"text": "I would have given 3.5.\n\nSome have given this place high marks just for being a great neighborhood bar but I am focused more on the food so can't speak to its bar life so to speak.\n\nThe obvious high marks are what others have already simply stated...great, hidden gem, neighborhood feel, house converted, bla bla bla...Yes, that's all very true.  \n\nBring your glasses if you have poor eyesight because this place is very dimly lit but I think it adds to the romantic aspect and it makes it pretty cozy.\n\nThe service was mediocre...I have to give a shout out to the buff host that has been there all 3 times that I have.  He looks like an abercrombie model that moonlights as the host of Alexander Michael's.  He just makes me smile for some reason.  But as far as the wait staff..eh, ok.  They seemed overly busy and understaffed quite honestly.  I hated to even ask any questions to our waitress in fear of flight.  She didn't stick around and she seemed to just have too much going on in general.  Whatever, no big deal.  \n\nThe food I think is consistently good.  The fried pickles are good, their cajun fries are crispy, good flavor, their other sides are OK, not amazing.  I tried their veggie and quinoa burger and I thought it was pretty good!  My friend had the burger and wasn't asked how she wanted it cooked so that was a BAD sign.  Not fresh.  Aaaand, it wasn't.  It was a little dry, not much flavor, just bleh in general.  The prices are right for their burgers and sandwhiches but they really should be based on the quality.\n\nThey have other specials and regular meal items that may be amazing but overall I think everything is just basic, consistent, good, not great.\n\nI wouldn't go out of my way to go back but I wouldn't kick and scream if invited to go again. Had a dinner date with my best friend here during restaurant week.  I've never been to Capital Grille so I was excited to try it out.  I have only heard good things so I can't say that I wasn't a little disappointed with a few things...\n\nI thought it would be safe to try a place like CG for Restaurant week because it is truly a chance to get more bang for your buck.  However, I am pretty sure everything switched once we said we were there for Queens Feast.  The server had been so polite and accomidating up until the point of our decision to order from the Queen's Feast.  After that moment I don't think we saw him the rest of the night, not even to bring us our food.  Seriously!  You may think I am kidding but I'm not!\n\nHe brought us bread with literally only 2 small rolls in the basket.  We had bread envy because we could see all the other tables with with bountiful bread baskets!  We figured it was because there was only two of us but the other tables only had two people as well but they had way more!  Well, we ended up asking for more bread and he never brought it.  We asked the other gentleman that was supposed to be assisting with our table as well and he brought it about 15 minutes later.  \n\nOur glasses of water were empty the majority of our time there.\nWe both ordered Filet Mignon which was very tasty.  It was warm, not hot when it came out but still very tender and nicely flavored.  We both ordered it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly.  Two sides came with our meal and I think they were supposed to be family style but they were really what you would see if they were served on an individual plate.  The mashed potatoes were sticky/gummy and lukewarm.  They were served in the smallest family style portion I have ever seen.  Unless it was a small family of ants, I would say we got screwed on the potatoes.  The string beans were cold and hard (undercooked) and inedible.  Didn't touch them.\n\nThe desserts were decent.  The flourless chocolate cake was so rich it was unbearable.  It was the dark bitter chocolate flavor that just wasn't very good.  The small bite of cheesecake was good though.  Just....small.\n\nOverall, I would say this experience was subpar, especially for the reputation of the restaurant.  Why does service and quality AND quantity have to suffer because it is restaurant week?  They did all seem overly busy so I understand that everything isn't going to be perfect but we didn't even see our waiter the rest of the evening until he flung our check at us.  I guess I would say it was just overall disappointing.  The steak saved the day.  That was some darn good steak.\n\nNot in a hurry to come back....other competitors have won my heart.", "user_id": "3GteArKIVRlJZjjRqqwgaQ", "business_id": "ePP0Eqz8JKSbtdt2phiB4A"}
{"text": "I am not one of those people who raves obsessively about Al Mike's but I do think that the place is unique and has a great ambiance. I have not yet tried the London Broil, which I've heard is one of their more popular dishes, but I have had the She-Crab soup and it is very delicious! \n\nThe staff is always very friendly and I love the older wooden benches (They are similar to those of 300 East.) At night, candles are lit and it feels very comfy and cozy inside. I think this would be a good place for a first date but the menu isn't terribly extensive or expensive (if that's what you're going for on a first date...) You can order entrees, as well as salads or appetizers like quesadillas. The bar has a nice beer selection as well. It is located in the heart of 4th ward, snuggled between houses and cobble stone streets, which can make it a little difficult to find but perfect if you live in uptown and can walk to the restaurant while taking in the beautiful houses and scenery along the way.\n\nFull Disclosure: Ladies... if you want the REAL reason to visit Alexander Michaels, here it is.. COOPER. He is one hell of a handsome man that works here. I have seen him a few times while visiting here and he has been extremely helpful and charming each time. I sat at a table facing the door last time I was here and watched every single woman, young and old, swoon over Cooper as he greeted them at the door with a huge, bright smile. I am normally not impressed by the looks of most men but Good Lord help me if he is single. I don't think I could handle it. \n\nI also hope Cooper does not frequent Yelp.com... \n;) My mouth is watering just thinking of the Capital Grille in Charlotte. I don't get to come here that often considering the price tag, but when I do, it's always nothing short of super fantastic. This particular Capital Grille is very classy from the service to decor to the selections of food and wine. The staff is very attentive, professional and informative. The food is insanely delicious and could feed you for days on end! \n\nCapital Grille, hands down, receives my Best Cheesecake in Charlotte award! I usually describe their cheesecake as this: \"It's a NY cheesecake, with a cookie dough-like crust instead of a graham cracker crust, and with a creme-brulee sugar-flambeed topping.\" It's freakin' unbelievable! I would get just that cheesecake to-go on a random night if I ever wanted to! \n\nBut I digress... They also have a nice patio on the sidewalk of Tryon and 5th St. if you fancy people-watching while you enjoy a 4 course meal. They've also just added a lunch bites menu that is for those who need to eat and run at a much smaller price than their usual dinner fare.\n\nCapital Grille is just the place to go if you're looking to impress business clients, for a classy date night or for a special occasion with family or friends. Make a reservation and be prepared to eat/drink like royalty and drop money like you're makin' it rain! If you live nearby and are looking for a casual sports bar to watch games and drink beer, Stool Pigeons is fair enough for just that. But beyond that, total Meh. The food is not very special at all. It's mainly fried, greasy traditional bar choices and the service can be good depending on which server or bartender you get. The customer service in general is not great and I've heard several people say this. \n\nAs Anish said, the bar is good for happy hour after work because you can literally drink and eat for super cheap. Each day they also have a $4.99 lunch special. Most people who eat here during lunch only order the lunch special.. so that should tell you something about the quality of the food there.\n\nThey do have a lot of TV's and it still gets a decent crowd during football games... but it is definitely NOT what it  used to be back in the day. \n\n(Disclosure: I used to work here but this is still my honest opinion. I've held back some of my thoughts here actually.)\n\nBonus: they have a TON of good beer on draft. It's probably about 20-25 beers on tap and they change quite often. If you catch them on a special draft night then SCORE if you're a beer lover!! They also have a fun little patio and it's prime location for people watching too.", "user_id": "-3akdU5UTDn6dwiTCO2cAw", "business_id": "ePP0Eqz8JKSbtdt2phiB4A"}
{"text": "Sports bars. I've been to good ones and bad ones. Champions located in the Marriott City Center is right in the middle. Nothing to write home about but it has all the basics. \n\nWant to catch a game? There are plenty of TV's around. The weird thing is that every screen was tuned to the same game when we walked in. We asked the bartender to put the Olympics up on a couple of them and she complied right away. So the trick to get what you want- lies in the hands of the bartender. (isn't that always the case?)\n\nLooking for food? This place has tons of choices. Granted, none of them are gourmet, but for bar food, it was okay. And the portion sizes? Huge! Ordered some cheese fries and the plate of waffle fries was piled high and smothered in cheese, scallions, tomatoes and ground beef. Almost like a nachos plate. \n\nWant a beer? Rather than tell you what kind she has the bartender will point to a display across the room that you can pick your favorite from. It was my least favorite move of the night, as the service up to that point was pretty good.   Had it been me ordering that- I might have pushed back. As for my friend? He just glanced and ordered. \n\nAnd finally- the ambiance. Dark. Dark wood and dark lighting. This is a guy's place and if you are walking by the outside looking in- you may think the place is empty, but take a peek inside. My guess is there will be quite a crowd as was evidenced all the times we popped in. \n\nA sports bar is never going to be my first choice of where to grab a beer. But if it's sports you are looking for- check this place out. Just make sure the bartender knows what it is YOU want to watch. It's more fun that way! What a great find in Charlotte! Mert's Heart and Soul is just that- a little bit of food love in the city. \n\nWe went for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. As we pushed open the door- we were greeted by Robin who quickly seated us, took note of my lack of accent and asked where I was from, and got us going with some great cornbread and butter as we sipped our beers and looked over the menu. \n\nBreakfast? Lunch? Breakfast? Lunch? Well breakfast won out but only by a fraction of a point as the southern fried chicken and mashed potatoes and green beans were definitely calling to me. \n\nBut I went with the omelet with ham and cheese and a side of buttermilk pancakes. My dining companion went with the eggs and country ham (ooh- that is some salty ham!) Both were served with a side of home fries. The food was great. But the service was even better. \n\nRobin took great care of us, making sure we had everything we needed and told me I just \"had to try\" the cornbread so she brought that out as well. Loved the music- Sam Cooke, and Sam and Dave played through our entire breakfast adding to the ambiance. \n\nThis is not a fancy place. But one that serves up good food, with friendly service and reasonable prices. Breakfast for two with drinks ran about $34. Definitely on my list to go back to the next time I'm in Charlotte. Located off the lobby of the Marriott hotel, Savannah Red is a small restaurant (50 seats), brightly decorated, that has been dubbed the \"boldest food in Charlotte\" by the James Beard Foundation. \n\nI personally never got past the cute bar up front as it was Valentines Day weekend and we didn't have a reservation, but based on the special prix fixe menus that I saw, and the food coming out of the kitchen, it looked delicious! The menu is filled with southern treats with a modern twist. \n\nStaying at the small bar (6 upholstered chair stools, max) had it's own benefits. We got excellent service for a wide range of drinks and good conversation by the bartender, manager and server.. I loved that they were pouring champagne freely and the server, Tonya, was buoyant, personable and, as it turns out, a fellow Yelper! \n\nNext time I'm in Charlotte- you can bet I am going to eat here. I have to try out a menu that people described to me as amazing.

{"text": "I've been to the Waldhorn several times now - and I'm always torn about writing a review!\n\nPlace gets high marks for quality and quantity of food - especially the homemade pretzel style dinner rolls (I could make a meal out of those and a beer or two).\n\nBiggest negative for me is the noise level.  We had five people in a large booth - and I could not hear the two people at the other end of my booth!  Compounding the noise problem - the strolling accordian player who wanted to serenade the booth beside us.  I'm sure the accordianist (is that the correct word?) is a very nice person and genuinely wants to add to your Bavarian meal experience.  But I just wished he'd go entertain the other side of the dining room!\n\nTheir 10th annual (according to the advertising materials that came with the check) Oktoberfest is coming up.  They run it for three consecutive weekends in September and I understand it's quite the party.  Haven't been yet but am considering it this year. Went for lunch today - and very upset that they now CHARGE a $3 fee for a basket of the pretzel rolls at lunch!\n\nSuggestion to the restaurant - simply ask each table if they want bread.  If they say no, you save the cost of the bread.  If they say yes, the bread is likely to be eaten.  \n\nThe charge for the bread isn't worth alienating good customers.\n\nBTW, we didn't have an inexpensive lunch.  Tab for four of us - including two glasses of wine, one beer, three after meal specialty drinks, one dessert and the aforementioned basket of rolls - was over $100.  Did the $3 bread really impact the restaurant profit margin that much? This is where the birthday girl wanted to go last night so this is where we went.\n\nBest surprise - a free slice of Black Forest cake with the purchase of any two dinner entrees.  This is the Tuesday special and it's large enough for two to share.\n\nTable ordered the wienerschnitzel, sauerbrauten and chicken nadia.  Three entrees, two glasses of wine, one large draft beer, a cup of coffee and the free Black Forest cake ran $80 including tip. Savannah Red - Adam, Deanna and all of their helpers - did a magnificient job caring my small company (12 person) Christmas dinner!\n\nFirst of all, the hotel (restaurant is located in the Marriott City Center) was packed with runners for the marathon the next day.  (My only minor beef is that the restaurant could use better signage off the hotel lobby.)  Yet Adam, Deanna and their staff made us feel like we were the only ones in the place.  Service was attentive but not intrusive and kept the evening moving along.\n\nWe enjoyed cocktails in the small bar area and it felt like a private club.  Deanna answered questions knowledgably and provided great suggestions when requested.\n\nDinner was served (and the entire room reserved for us) in the space used for breakfast - but you'd never have known it from the feel.  It was candlelit and intimate without being close and claustrophobic.  Can't wait for next year when we have enough people to take over the intimate dining room!\n\nWhere do I begin with the food?  Creative, unique menu that I've never seen anywhere else in Charlotte.  Heavily focused on meat, chicken and seafood (sorry, my vegetarian friends) and all executed to perfection.  My personal favorite - the Krispy Kreme Bread Pudding for dessert.\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant for both the food and for the service.

{"text": "This Olive Garden sometimes has problems in the kitchen.  One time I visited they changed the pasta fagioli soup from a hearty meat based soup to a runny tomato based one.  The pasta fagioli soup is my only reason to get soup and salad for dinner because it's usually really good.  \n\nSo I wrote to corp through their website and they sent me a gift certificate.  I gave this location another try and thankfully it's back to normal.  So go with caution and be prepared to deal with lackluster performance.  I love OG on the whole and give most locations at least four stars, but this one has done it's best to tarnish their image. The food looks great so I'd definitely try it again for lunch or dinner.  But it's a tiny space, even with the upstairs, so don't go on weekends if you don't like being mauled to death by overly tan twenty somethings in polo shirts. Piranhas couldn't have cleaned my plate faster.  I haven't laid into a piece of chicken like that in decades.  They make chicken like my momma did with the skin so crispy and the meat too hot too handle.  Mine was still steaming while I was dismantling it like a lion on a zebra in the Serengeti.  The bbq rib combo is juicy and would leave me wanting more if I hadn't just murdered half a plate of green beans, red rice and corn bread.  I was sopping it up with abandon.  \n\nHeart and soul is right.  There's nothing but love on the plates at Mert's.  I can't think of anywhere else in recent history where utensils like a knife and fork suddenly became an impediment to enjoying such amazingly good food.  Put your napkin in your lap, throw your table manners to the wind and enjoy.  This is down-home cooking in a casual atmosphere and reasonably priced.  It can be very busy and I recommend trying it out your first time when it's not dinner rush or on a weekend.  But even if you do it's well worth the wait. I can't think of anything due to my food coma but it was all five stars!  The blackberry sorbet was a perfect finish. Saturday after 11 DJ music was hip-hop heavy with the occasional reggaeton or slow song thrown in for good measure.  I don't listen to Beyonce or Pitbull on a regular basis but I had a blast anyway because the patrons make it so much fun.  For a $5 cover it was a straight-up (pun intended) good time.  \n\nDrinks are cheap.  Street parking is free of course and luckily close enough you can throw your coat in the trunk and hustle to the door before freezing your you-know-what off.\n\nDress comfortably, order your favorite drink and  you've exerted all the effort you need.  The bartender was awesome and did not keep anyone waiting.  Hartigan's arguably has the best disco balls in town.  The regulars come here to dance! Tiny little pub, very casual and the bartenders are nice.  You've got your well heeled tourists, scruffy locals, gay kids and gang bangers all crammed together wondering what the hell is going on.  It's an amazing moment to suddenly be here, get drunk and then just as quickly spin off out into the rest of the city to carry on with who knows what the heck you were trying to do in the first place.  But you remember that weird little bar with the claustrophobic energy being right in the middle of it all. We went on Saturday night.  Loved the bruschetta!  The best we'd had in a while.  The wine selection is a little over the top but everything else seemed reasonably priced.  The meat sauce on their spaghetti with meatballs was pleasantly rustic and garlicky.  The half chicken was huge but overall portions weren't ridiculous.  If we hadn't been out all day and starving by the time we got there, we might have tried dessert.  Our server was great too but we noticed another table with a different server wasn't getting appropriate attention.  So they may still be working on adequate staff.  Still, we would go back.

{"text": "I'm going to be the odd person and not give this place a glowing review.\n\nFirst off, the atmosphere is actually cool.  This is a true pub.  Beautiful dark wood is everywhere.  The staff is also very nice, no complaint there.\n\nThe thing is, I don't really have a complaint, I'm just not impressed with the food.  I find it acceptable, but nothing special.  In fact, the menu is, to me, kinda boring.  I think the point of this place is more to go \"have a few\" after work and such.  When looking for great food in uptown, this place wouldn't make my list.  I do love that it's locally owned and operated, however, and harbor no ill feelings. Funky little vibe place with a nice selection of great sandwiches.  And tater tots!!!\n\nWent here for a date night and had a good time.  Friendly service and one of a few places that actually serves good tater tots.  I don't drink so I didn't pay much attention to the bar, but I hear they have good specials. Located in Uptown and easy to access, this place should have had no problem earning 5 stars from me.  I'm usually pretty generous when it comes to review because I know how hard the service industry is.  However, LaVecchia's needs to take notes, because they have a lot lacking.\n\nWe arrived at 7:25 for our 7:30 reservation.  Not all of our party was there so we were told we could wait in the building lobby and they would get our table ready soon.  At 7:45 we were still waiting, everyone was there and I had watched them seat several other tables who said they had no reservations.  So, I asked about our table and the hostess rolled her eyes and sighed and said they were still working on it.  When I mentioned that our reservation had been for earlier, she said \"well, everyone else had reservations, too, Ma'am!\" and just walked off.  I promptly labeled her the anit-hostess and another member of our party (of 5) went to find the front house manager.\n\nThe manager seated us but acted like he did us this huge favor.  We were seated in the bar, next to the patio door, so we had the bracing blasts of cold air throughout our meal as staff went in and out this door all night long.\n\nOur waiter was in no hurry to take care of us.  Once we ordered our drinks, he never came back with any more water, and one member of our party had to flag him down each time he wanted another beer.  \n\nOur food finally came and at last, redemption!!  Every single bite was perfection!  I had the filet, my husband had lobster and two others had the snapper.  Everyone oohed and ahhed over our meals.  \n\nPrice point wise I feel we got what we paid for strictly in terms of food and food quality.  The presentation was lovely, temp was good... I really could not find anything to negate the food.\n\nService is a different story.  It was painfully obvious that the wait-staff was stressed by the front manager.  He really seemed to have an attitude about even being there.  The hostess was rude and off-putting from the moment we arrived and when we were seated commented that they \"worked it out\" for us, like she had to prove something. I still don't know exactly what her deal was.\n\nBottom line:  If you want me to pay $200 for a meal, you need to act like you're glad I showed up.  Drop the bad attitude and step it up.  There are load of other upscale establishments in Charlotte that get it done.  We'll be going to a different one next time.", "user_id": "epELYRU4ZftAKpL88m3atw", "business_id": "ePP0Eqz8JKSbtdt2phiB4A"}
{"text": "I have to laugh b/c this is the second time I find myself quoting Nicole W. but she said it best \"Alexander Michael's is the quintessential go-to spot for solid food, good drinks and superb company all packaged into a quaint little spot in the 4th ward.\"\n\nEspecially if you live within walking distance, this is a place you will go again and again for an uncomplicated place to find simple food done right with quality beer selections.  I had the chicken pita.  I was not expecting that the chicken would be perfectly cooked, seasoned and the pita warm and robust.  A side of beans satisfied an additional protein craving without the temptation of the go-to french fries.\n\nThe place is too cute explaining on the back of the menu why there is a beam in the ladies room which finds itself the victim of unsuspecting visitors who inevitably find themselves in close contact with the supporting structure.  They also give some history on the house which makes good reading while you wait for your first round to show up.  \n\nSmall complaint that again, tv in the dining area.  I guess many people eat in front of the television at home and grow accustom to it?  Also, low ceilings make for a cozy atmosphere.  Probably not the #1 place for enjoying the natural sunlight of a gorgeous day. It was the bar specials sign that gave me a craving for sliders while walking home from work one night.  My husband and I went in for Cheeseburger sliders and Petite Filet  Mignon sandwiches.  Combine this with the drink specials and you have a winning combination.\n\nThe bar area is cozy and separated from the main dining area in it's own room.  The dark wood and warm colors make it an inviting place for a small bite (though portions were a meal size for me).  There are a couple tables, a few high tops and a decent amount of seating at the bar. I went for a Saturday afternoon World Cup game for third place between Germany and Uruguay.  Most tables in front of the screen were taken but not packed so it wasn't too noisy.  Service was really slow but the waitress was authentic.  Not the best review since I ordered a salad at a pub but the salad was good & fresh.  I tried the sweet potato fries too.  The fries were a little soggy but will go back under different circumstances to try them out since the beer selection is extensive and within walking distance. I went back to RiRa's for lunch today and sat on their rooftop terrace to enjoy the gorgeous weather.  I ordered the hummus wrap with the vegetable stack.  It was delicious!  \n\nThey also had a breakfast/brunch menu.  My husband ordered an omlette with brisket.  He commented on the fresh eggs and cheese but said the brisket was the star of the show.  He was pleased that the brisket was mixed into the omlette not just folded over the ingredients.\n\nThe omlette came with potatoes and a thick cut of toast perfectly toasted.  I mean where else can you get brunch severed with such a great beer selection?! My husband and I headed over early on a Tuesday night.  To our surprise it is buy one get one tapas until 7 so upon realizing our luck we opted for 4 items to test the place out.  We were glad we did.\n\n1)  Chicken satay: chicken was tender and the seasonings were minimal but the peanut sauce looked like it was scooped out of a jar, was thicker than peanut butter with a sticky texture.\n2) Lucky 7 Roll: The menu says that it is homemade, but if it is I think it has since been reheated.  It had an interesting mix of flavors but the outside tasted more like a thin corn taco.\n3) Crostini (Filet Mingon): 3 small, flavor and lifeless filets over jam on a white bread crostini.\n4) Souvlaki (beef skish-kabobs): Again, light on flavor, over cooked.\n\nI don't recommend this place, at least for tapas and I won't go back for a full dinner but the atmosphere was laid back, the service was very good and if you work in the area it seems like a good spot to stop in for a drink.  That said, living in 4th ward there are so many other choices on my walk between here and there, I probably won't make it intentional to go back.", "user_id": "iw71Q7AwGWfBvULvWcKuwA", "business_id": "ePP0Eqz8JKSbtdt2phiB4A"}
{"text": "I love Al Mike's. The restaurant is hidden in the beautiful First Ward neighborhood. They've got great food, a good beer list and a very chill atmosphere. I typically get the blue cheese burger, while my boyfriend loves to get the London broil sandwich or the pita chicken wrap with honey mustard. The fries and onion rings are delicious too. Plus, it's non-smoking, which I LOVE. I just wish it stayed open later. Matt's Chicago Dog is a great lunch spot. The Chicago-style hot dogs are done well, but I often find myself getting the grilled chicken sandwich and fries (which are the perfect level of greasy and salty). Plus, it's affordable. Lunch normally runs me $7 or $8. Matt's is often packed with Wachovia employees at lunchtime. If you've got a flexible schedule, I'd go there around 11:30 or 1:30 to avoid the rush. I had some friends in town from Chicago and they really wanted to find a bar to watch a Bears game. So we headed to Fox & Hound to check it out. My friend quickly dubbed the bar a \"Football Model UN\" because of the variety of football fans there. Fox & Hound probably had 10 games going in different areas of the bar, and being such a newcomer cite, there were fans from all over. I can't speak much to the food, but if you're looking for a place to drink and watch football, it seems like a good spot to hit up. I haven't spent much time at RiRa's for late-night drinking, mostly because of its reputation for being crowded. But I had an awesome, nap-inducing dinner there one night. \n\nMy friend and I had done an afternoon fundraiser/bar crawl one day and we were starving afterward. We headed to RiRa's at around 5 pm, before any of the crowds got there, and we were seated upstairs. We were the only people up there for most of our meal. Had we been on a date, the candle-lit atmosphere would have been awesome. I had the beef and Guiness stew. It was heavy and so so delicious. So my point is that if RiRa's doesn't suit you as a bar, definitely try the food during a less-busy time. It's well worth it. If you're new to Charlotte and still adjusting to living in the New South, go to Mert's Heart & Soul in uptown. I can pretty much guarantee that the macaroni and cheese, sweet tea, biscuits, meatloaf and all the other soul food will remind you why Charlotte is a good place to live. \n\nYou can order food from Mert's online, which is a convenient perk. I've been to a couple events catered by Mert's. Mm mm. Mimosa is fantastic. I went there for lunch recently for my friend's birthday. I had the best cheeseburger I've ever had in my life. It was topped with bacon and cheddar cheese, but the burger itself was just seasoned perfectly. Mm mm. It is on the pricey side, but it's definitely more reasonably priced for lunch, so I'd recommend checking it out then. As other Yelpers have said, it's just one of those restaurants where everything you order is likely to be good. The lunch special at the Pizzeria Uno is a good deal, so that must be why we keep going back even though we have terrible service time after time. Don't go there if you're looking for a quick lunch. The servers are usually absent-minded and it takes a while for your food to come out. The pizza is all right, but as a Chicagoan, it can't compare to the true deep dish pizza back home. If you go, the flatbread quesadillas are a good dish to try.", "user_id": "ITwewV_k1EcFgxfWNlssqQ", "business_id": "ePP0Eqz8JKSbtdt2phiB4A"}
{"text": "Good fried pickles. Good Chocolate Martini. When I moved to Charlotte someone took me here and then I didn't know anywhere else to go yet, so I would go here quite a lot - even took my visiting family here. It's a good bar, joint, eatery, but after I found more stuff, I never returned... not sure why..\n\nI do have fond memories of the chocolate martini... There is nothing wrong with this place, in fact, it is superb.. that being said.. the real value in Morton's is the quality of the meats and seafood.. the experience is similar to Ruth's Chris or Sullivan's or Del Frisco, but the freshness of the goods was just the slightest bit better..  they bring you the cuts and live lobster table side and show you the raw/live meat.. \n\nI have to say that having seen Michael Jordan at Del Frisco and Yao Ming at Morton's... the other value is seeing famous people in Charlotte. \n\nIf you want the ultimate steak..  and have the money to spend.. go for it, but if you are just looking for a nice place to take someone special this one compares to it's slightly less expensive brothers... Beer - Many choices and micro-brews (I dont drink beer, but if you do, there is lots here)\nSalads - Meh\nBurgers - Good\nWine - Meh\nCoffee - Meh\nSoup - So/so\nTex-Mexish dishes - were actually ok\nStuffed bell peppers - actually quite good\n\nThis isn't my kind of place, but we stop in for lunch now and then because it's downstairs from where we work. When you walk by outside, the smell of the brewing is so strong!\n\nI say A-OK, because it's not my style, but it is a good micro-brewery with burgers, fries etc. The stuff you expect. Lots of seating and service is A-Ok. They have a nice patio as well. Very pricey, but a great dining experience. The calamari is yummy, but HOT as in spicy..  Lobster and Steak is where it's at and if you somehow escaped the recession blues throw in a bottle of Silver Oak Cab... Dropped in for lunch at an odd hour between lunch and dinner. The place was empty so we had the best server to ourselves and a great table.\n\nThis is one of those places where even for lunch, you are going to drop a dime to eat or drink the awesomeness. \n\nI started with a cup of the clam chowder, then had the sliders along with the homemade grapefruit soda. YUM!\n\nThe french onion soup is really good too. My friend had that.\n\nEverything was awesome. Normally this sort of place is too \"stuffy\" for my style - but I have to admit, the experience is always perfection. Our server brought us over a little amuse bouche' as well - the squash soup - so yummy - it tastes like the season. A well kept secret! If you are looking for wine treats, you have to check this out. It is like a little wine store located right inside the department store. They do tastings and classes and have a special room for the fine stuff.. I have only just peeked through the glass, but YUM! Cute little hole in the wall diner on the edge of Uptown. I work across the way from here and decided to pop in for lunch. They have a huge menu for such a little place - so I settled on the Quiche of the day - OMG - so yummy. I mean, it was the way quiche should be with a crisp light fluffy biscuity crust and a heavy egg base with good flavor - i wanted another piece when I was done. I got a side salad with it to save on carbs and that was very delish with a vinaigrette dressing.\n\nThat being said - this is a very no frills place. A little counter, some cheap tables and a self service drink area - it's a bit dark inside and the decor consists of some random framed prints here and there.\n\nRegardless of the lack of ambiance - the food is bringing the people in - the place had a good crowd at lunch time and the proprietor is a British lady who is very patient and friendly. \n\nI saw someone eating a burger and I was like - OH YEA! It did look very good - Diner Burger good. You know what I mean. Like, I am not counting calories, good.\n\nThe line moved pretty fast, you order at the counter, seat yourself and they call you when it's ready - you help yourself to the drink you ordered from a little area behind the counter - and just so you know, aside from soft drinks, coffee etc. They do have Perrier - which I love!\n\nI'll be back - very cute little old timey diner!", "user_id": "ZcEstCa4fDhNXrkZ8_Gh0Q", "business_id": "ePP0Eqz8JKSbtdt2phiB4A"}
{"text": "Rock Bottom Brewery has a great location and huge space, including bar area and indoor/outdoor seating. I've been a few times for lunch during the week and twice for dinner. It gets pretty busy at lunch time so try to arrive a little before noon or around 12:45pm in order to beat the lunch crowd rush. I've not had a problem getting a seat for dinner. And I've always had great service. \n\nThe menu is huge (literally) with tons to choose from in terms of beverages and food. The fish tacos are good and the chicken picatta was okay but I found myself scraping off the extra sauce, and the green beans that came with it were overdone and soggy. I did enjoy the french fries. \n\nWhere Rock Bottom falls slightly short is the prices. They're frankly too high for this type of establishment (in my mind it's similar to Applebee's or Outback). And as always, parking is a little tough uptown. Ultimately, if you're looking for somewhere to go and the other uptown restaurants are packed, Rock Bottom is a solid choice. Just don't expect to be overwhelmed. Capital Grille is not a place that we go often (due to it being a bit on the pricey side), but every time we do decide to splurge, it's been fantastic. \n\nDrinks: you MUST have a stoli doli martini. So delish. That said, why not have two and really kick up your heels?\n\nStarters: I realize that shrimp cocktail might be considered a boring choice, but with jumbo shrimp and cocktail sauce with a kick, you'll be happy you choose this route. The mixed green salad with champagne vinegarette and the tomato mozzarella salad are also great starters (but you may want to split the later as it's quite large).\n\nMain course: I don't eat red meat, but everyone I've dined with says that Capital Grille has the best steaks around. The salmon is also very good, and the portion size ridiculous; you'll definitely have some to take home.\n\nSides: you must have the creamed spinach. Even if you abhor spinach you will love this dish (which tells you just how healthy it is). The asparagus and mashed potatos are also solid side choices.\n\nDessert (my favorite course): get the cheesecake; you will not regret it. The top is torched like creme brulee and it comes with whip cream and berries. I've also had some of their  homemade ice cream (mint), and it was very good as well. The chocolate cake is very rich, but with a bit of ice cream on top, the perfect chocolately end to your evening.\n\nThey have a very helpful slew of valet attendants out front for free parking, so defintiely plan to use them. It's just not worth it to try to find a spot on your own, especially if you're going uptown on the weekend for dinner (at which point, you should definitely make a reservation). \n\nIf you're looking for great food, service, and to save a little money, this is the place to choose when perusing the restaurant week menu. Or if you have a special occassion and feel like splurging, Capital Grille is a sure bet. Sonoma is one of those restaurants with a cool atmosphere, convenient uptown location, and a great looking menu. I've been quite a few times for lunch and it was really good, so we decided to try it out for dinner on a Friday night, which is what this review will focus on. \n\nWe got to the restaurant a bit early so we could enjoy an appetizer and drinks before dinner. We ordered the hummus, which is served with pita slices and crackers. It is some of the best hummus I've ever had, and there were even a few olives to nosh on while we had our drinks. Service in the bar area was very good. \n\nMoving into the dinner portion of the evening, the service was still great. The food options for dinner were slightly lacking in my opinion. So lacking that I ended up ordering the goat cheese and herb chicken (I hardly ever order chicken when eating out since we have it at home all the time). The chicken was good, but placed on mashed potatoes that were literally drowning in butter sauce. I hardly ate any of them. \n\nWe both ordered the delicious tomato bisque for a starter. My dining partner ordered the hanger steak and hardly ate any of it; said it was really not good at all. In all actuality, he ended up eating half of my chicken. For dessert we split the chocolate torte with vanilla ice cream, which was very rich (as a chocolate torte should be). \n\nAlso, note to that if you're going to valet (which is highly recommended for parking uptown), it's off of College Street, not Trade. Ultimately, I would highly recommend Sonoma for lunch but not so much for dinner. There are too many other great restaurants uptown with better dinner options.", "user_id": "tm_HvdZmUMGht1-xjGQF7Q", "business_id": "ym9QwkmB5ZKTyj7q5huTDw"}
{"text": "Had the Shrimp Po Boo.  I wish I know that it would be spicy I would have asked them to hold the spice.  Even the Home Fries where spicy.  I understand that it's southern home cooking, however other items on the menu warn that it's spicy.  I understand it's not a four star restaurant, however the batter on the popcorn shrimp could have more crispy.  Perhaps the fryer was not to temperature when they sunk them.  Despite the spiciness of the potatoes they where fresh and not cooked that long, although personally I do like crispy home fries.  Having said that portion was good size, price average with other restaurants in the area.  Service was my biggest issue.  While the waitress did keep checking back to see if we where ready to order, however she never asked if I would like another Ice Tea.  I needed usually needed to wait and attempt to attract her attention. Went last night for dinner to celebrate a friend's birthday.  Restaurant not crowded, I noticed only Jody with a trainee.  Jody was our server, professional attire and attitude, however energetic.  She seemed happy with her job.  Immediately upon coming to the table she introduced herself and her trainee, asked if it was our first time at the restaurant, I explained yes, and she stated that the restaurant was a Steakhouse/Seafood restaurant, and proceeded to mention some of the more popular item on the menu in addition to 1 or 2 that happen to be her favorites.  She also asked if we what type of water we would like to drink (Pellegrino, bottle, or tap).  I opted for the Pellegrino water and she asked if I would like a small or large bottle.  I opted for the large, and she proceeded to bring it with some lime wedges, which I think adds a little bit of flavor to it.  \n\n     We proceed to order other non-alcoholic drinks and then started in on the menu.  Menu layout is easy to read to prices are stated next to the menu item.  On a couple places on the menu they've made comments about the dangers of eating raw or undercooked foods, which I thought was nice to see.  Both my friend and I ordered the Surf & Turf.  The Surf & Turf comes with an 8oz Filet Mignon and a 7 oz. lobster tail, with whipped potatoes and asparagus for sides all over a red wine demi glaze.  After a while Jody brought some warm bread and Olive Oil with oregano and balsamic vinegar to the table.  What can I say other than perfection.  The crust on the outside was like a hard bread, but the inside was soft and light.  To mix it with the olive oil combination was just perfection.  The flavors just all come together to give you this burst of flavor with our being too strong.  We waited some time for our dinners, and Jody had come back to the table 2 or 3 times apologizing about the wait, explaining that the lobster tails are taking a little bit longer.  A few moments after finishing our bread out came our Surf & Turf.   I've not had a lobster tail before, and WOW was I surprised.  The lobster tail was huge. I learned that they had substituted their normal 7oz lobster tail for a 12oz lobster tail.  Which made the dinner that more special for us.  I ordered mine Medium and wow was it tender.  It seemed to just melt in my mouth.  Well-seasoned and cooked to medium perfection.  The whipped potatoes with some demi glaze slightly drizzled over the top just enhanced them.  The asparagus where cooked to al dente and had their nice dark green color and firm texture, also along with some of the demi glaze on them it was like a party in my mouth.  Throughout dinner Jody had stopped to check on us and see how we were enjoying everything, and refilling our drinks.  I think there was really only 1 time that I needed to worry about a refill of my tea, other times Jody was one the ball making sure I had more tea before I was empty.  \n\n     Overall the service, food, and atmosphere was superb.  The only professional objection was there was one time the Jody went to fill my glass, and instead of bringing the glass to her or asking me to do so, she just reached in front of me to finish of the bottle of Pellegrino.  One of the first rules in good service is you never stretch yourself in front of the guest.  If you cannot reach the glass then you politely request the guest to move it towards you.  This I think was just an oversight, on Jody's part.  It was also difficult coming from the garage elevator to know where to go for the restaurant.  I understand that the establishment is at the mercy of the landlord regarding any type of signage, so this I cannot fault the restaurant for.  In conclusion, I would hold definitely hold these up to some of the caliper of The Capital Grill and other precarious restaurant's in uptown Charlotte.  Thank You Aquavina for a very enjoyable time and celebration of food!", "user_id": "7XfyN8ljXeqYnt9sVBP-uQ", "business_id": "mpDxBBGywUE6GRRKja3sBA"}
{"text": "I REAAAALY wanted to have one of the best steaks in a while, but it just wasn't that great.  I'd give the food 4 stars at best, but the price was utterly ridiculous.\n\nIt was quite a busy night when I walked in this dimly lit restaurant with very prestigious decor.  We had reservations and were seated immediately.  We walked right past the local banking community at the bar.\n\nThe service was awesome, very attentive, but not quite stalking.\n\nI felt I was splurging enough, so laid off the booze, but pretty credible wine selection.  The onion loaf bread was great.  Me and my date each had different salads, I had the Cesar which had mediocre quality Parmesan shavings on top.  The other was a basic chef's with a champagne vinaigrette.  Was good, nothing to write home about.\n\nThen came the steaks.  We both ordered medium rare(as YOU should)  The tournedos with morel crust were raw in the middle but still pretty tasty.  Very subtle on the morel.  My kona rubbed sirloin was a little past medium.  $42 steak that wasn't even cooked right, WOW!  Decent flavor, but I could easily cook a better steak with a good beef an iron skillet and above average salt.  The sides lacked luster.  Just had some potatoes and greens.\n\nThen came desert, SO GOOD.  We had a cheesecake and a flan of sorts.  Both were amazing.  They were pretty much the only reason that I didn't complain about the meal.\n\nAll in all, it was restaurant week and I know they just push people through, but I was thoroughly disappointed. The food was good and I would probably be back if it was half the price(literally).  Although, I would ask in advance if they actually have any of the sides they offer.\n\nI wanted to take my lovely lady friend out for a nice meal and I didn't quite want to spend Capital Grill money.  So off to Aquavina we went.\n\nYour choices of parking are either on the street or in the parking deck, and they do validate.  After a nice little walk through the park you see their sign and you have to walk upstairs.  Once inside the decor is nice, but not overwhelming by any means.  The chunks of clay on the wall are interesting, I guess.  We sat at the bar to have a drink and wait for our booth.\n\nUpon being seated and seeing the menu I realized we were going to be spending capital grille money, but we were already there and I didn't want to look cheap.  We ordered spinach salads and the blue crab cheese fondue a long with a couple glasses of the malbec.  I liked the salad, but it was nothing special.  Lots of dressed spinach a little dollop of cheese and a \"onion ring\" style shallot.  The consistency of the blue crab fondue was a little too runny.  The flavor was full of seafood notes, which I liked, but the thin cheese on stale tasting toast points didn't do it for me.  The little copper pot it came in was cool though.  I took the left overs home and mixed it with a Gorgonzola and put it over broccoli, YUMMY!\n\nFor our entrees, the seafood didn't look like anything special and I'm pretty awesome at cooking salmon so we both went for steaks.  My counter part ordered the filet medium rare.  After some time It came out medium to medium well and was only an inch thick.  At $36, I was not impressed.  Her mushroom risotto lacked creaminess and only had a few little button mushrooms in it(could have been cremini).\n\nI ordered the RIbeye, it was large, but at almost $40 I was expecting an at least above average steak for that kind of money.  Shortly after I ordered my ribeye the waitress came back to tell me that they didn't have potatoes gratin and I needed to order something else.  After the blue crab cheese dip I was overloaded on cheese anyhow, so I didn't mind getting asparagus.  A few minutes later she came back to tell me they were out of asparagus as well.  At this point I had decided against carbs in general but I had no choice, so I ordered the baked potato.  One more time she came out and honestly I was getting pissed off.  They had no baked potatoes.  So, I just asked her, what do you have.  Mashed potatoes was my only choice.  For $40, they can't find I potato?\n\nWhen I finally got my meal, I noticed my mixed veggies almost looked like something out of those microwave steamer bags.  Little bit of peas, a couple spears of broccoli, and such.  The couple of mushroom bits I had did have some flavor.  My ribeye lacked any of this chimicurri that it was supposed to have, which was the main reason I ordered the malbec.  The waitress told me it was on there, I just couldn't see it.  I used to live with an Argentinian, you can see chimichurii, it almost looks like an oil heavy pesto.  I did get a side of it, and it did accentuate the flavor of the steak.  The steak was served on top of the overly buttered mash potatoes.  I ate them, but nothing special.\n\nAfter $150 for 2 people, I was not impressed.  Honestly, I don't see how they stay in business, I guess the bankers don't mind dropping that kind of loot on average food.  I may come back for lunch for the sandwiches or to try some of the seafood, but only if I'm already downtown and there aren't other options.", "user_id": "eFxX1tSNLmVkAP9kNv2--Q", "business_id": "CChwRoYVXA3QZulS8a6xOQ"}
{"text": "I wasted nearly twenty bucks on the driest and most boring white pizza ever! The whole dinner was nothing but a downer. Plus the sample we got was way undercooked, after eating the first slice we decided to bake it for another five minutes.\n\nOnce reheated the crust wasn't bad, not soggy or cardboard like but way thick for an alleged NY pizza. The topping unfortunately didn't get any worse or better for it, it was as solid as it was bland.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving it two stars rather than just one is that I suspect their plain pizza is better than average for this forsaken area. \n\nYou've been warned: in Matthews-Stallings 5 stars amounts to just average out on in the modern world, and 4 stars here translates to \"it's pretty much crap but we have no better\" . Two and a half stars, neither A-ok nor real bad. \nI was at Carolina Place around 1:30 pm and decided to give this restaurant a try -I was told it's the best Eyetalian in Charlotte.\n\nFirst the good part: I ordered the baked rigatoni with meat sauce and hot Italian sausage. It was excellent -if like me you like strong flavors and spicy both- nothing I'd expect from a chain restaurant. The lunch portion was huge, too much in fact.\nthat's it for the good.\n\nService was absolutely dismal for no good reason. It was neither busy nor a late hour for lunch. I think the dinner prices are very high for Southern Italian style pasta dishes, especially considering we're in Charlotte and I think their idea of \"family dining\" makes life easier for the cook but does nothing for the customer. \n\nMy idea of fun dining is exactly the opposite, I want to taste as many different things I can, not pig out on a mound of carbs. Pathetic, no other way to describe this brunch.\nI did have breakfast here once before and it wasn't this bad. Feel my pain: \n\n.....I get there on Sunday at 1:30pm after the rush was over. Their house special \"Eggs Benny\" covers the whole front of the menu. I order that with a cup of black coffee. I get the coffee then my waitress disappears until 20 minutes later when she brings me my plate. I stop her from running off because the food looks suspicious. Sure enough the poached eggs were hard boiled. \"Is that too cooked for you?\" YES.\n\nI wait and I wait and I wait ( just a few customers in the house) and a whole 15 minutes later she quickly drops off the new plate and runs off, NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN. It's been 35 minutes since I first ordered.\n\n One egg is borderline ok, the other is hard boiled again, the Hollandaise is dry and starting to curdle, the English muffins are not toasted properly and they're chewy as hell, the hash browns are absolutely tasteless. Not a micro-gram of salt, pepper, paprika, onions nothing to give it any flavor. \n\nNo waitress anywhere, not only mine but all the ladies wearing black tee-shirts are anywhere but in the dining room. After a few more minutes I lose patience, go to the counter find a waitress and ask her for my check.\n\nThe girl at the cash register asks me how was my meal and I tell her exactly how it went.... in detail. She is very very very sorry but doesn't offer to comp even the coffee. For maybe only the second or third time in my whole life I don't leave a tip. \n\nThe worst Eggs Benny I've ever had, coupled with ridiculously bad service: $15 and some change including a cup of coffee. That's right, over FIFTEEN DOLLARS for this.\n\nedit: check out the review that was filtered, I don't see why it was.

{"text": "Ate here for dinner with my mom; this was our fourth time here, to which my Mom thoroughly enjoys when visiting me while I'm okay about.  \n\nIn the most recent visit I ordered for appetizer the Goulash Soup, which I found it to be much creamer than expected.  The soup though was very good overall, with chunks of meat and potatoes floating in the mix.  Mom ordered a salad, she enjoyed it.  The rolls were also very good.\n\nFor the main course, I ordered the Wienerschnitzel, which was okay though a bit tough.  Mom ordered the  Rouladen, which she enjoyed greatly.  Overall, my Mom enjoyed the meal and evening, more than me, which is good.  Personally, I prefer the Sunday brunch more because its a buffet that I can pick what I want.  Overall, I give it four out of five. This is one of those places where the hype is bigger than reality.  Sure, it's an institution of a business that somehow survived the times without changing the decor for decades.  But the hot dogs aren't impressive at all, I was actually quite disappointed by them.  \n\nIn my order, I got two Carolina Style Dogs (mustard, onions, slaw and chili), with fries and a drink.  The drink is inundated with tons of ice, which quickly waters down any flavor the soda may have had.  The fries were so-so, nothing fancy about crinkle-cut.  The dogs were disappointing... since the hot dogs are cooked in a water pot, they should be dried off a little before putting in the bun; well, they didn't do that and I had a soggy buns as a result.  The slaw and chili didn't have any real flavor to them and probably would have been better without because of the mess.  Overall, I couldn't finish both dogs because it got too messy and tasted blah with the wet bun.\n\nHonestly, I have had better hot dogs from the Green's lunch cart located in front of Wells Fargo than the actual location.  Prices are the same, cheap, and that lady doesn't mess around with soggy buns.  If you want Green's lunch, go to the cart, not the establishment.  Overall, there are better hot dog places in Uptown, though will cost more. These hot dogs will be pricier than other hot dogs purchased in the immediate area, but these are good hot dogs.  During lunch time, a line will sometime go out the doors and their is a wait as they make your food fresh.  I recommend sticking with their hot dogs and sausages, which are very good quality and taste; the hamburgers they offer are bland in taste.  The combo includes a drink and chips/fries.  Overall, four out of five. When I use to work in Uptown Charlotte, I would typically eat here almost once a week.  It is rather small restaurant, and always has a line around Noon, but it's worth checking out.  Typically, I order the Tangerine Chicken with white rice and egg roll (substitute from spring roll); the wait time varies 5-10 minutes from order to table.  The portions are good compared to price and I never had any issues.  There is outside seating available, but its on the street and it can be pretty loud.  Overall, worth checking out if in the area and have a hankering for good Chinese food; if you go during the Lunch rush, try to go early or late. This Sonny's location has been recently refurbished, which looks better than it did before; though it is one of the smaller locations for this chain restaurant.  I do visit this Sonny's more often because of its proximity to I-77 (when driving by) and/or it's location in front of Costco, when I shop there; so I guess I'm somewhat of a regular.\n\nOn my last visit, I ordered the Pork 3-Way plate with fries, coleslaw, and sweet tea.  The order went fast, with food already on table within' five minutes.  The coleslaw was as expected: sweet, slightly creamy with a good crunch to it.  The fries were okay I guess, though a few were soft.  The pulled pork was very good, I drizzled it with sizzilin' sweet sauce on top and ate it with the garlic bread.  The sliced pork (which I asked to be chopped) was good too.  The ribs (dry rubbed) were probably the weakest on the plate, the underneath part of the rib was nothing but fat and was easy to scrap off by a knife; were kind of dry but not bad.  Overall, it was a good meal.\n\nThe waitress came by the table often to refill my drink without asking; overall good service.\n\nNow is this the best barbeque around, no... but it's not bad either.  Sonny's is one of the better barbeque chain restaurants in the southeast and this location is one of its better locations, and that is how I am rating it.", "user_id": "49Xz2Dn8ExaN86biA60KTw", "business_id": "2_0P2AmSSFtPgddio0MgYA"}
{"text": "I feel like all Sarku's taste the same, chicken is good and overall everything is pretty unsalty.

Al Mike's looks like a house that turned their 1st floor into a bar. The atmosphere is really chill, and they have good cheap beers on tap and serve typical bar food. There was plenty of street parking when I went. \n\nMy fave part of Al Mikes is that it's a very non-uptowny bar in uptown, check it out!\n\nBtw, what is with people and fried pickles?! The bagels here aren't as good as everyone said they would be. I actually think I like the Einstein's Bagel's bagel-cream cheese combo better. I personally prefer the plain bagel and cream cheese over the egg sandwiches because the eggs are kind of weird and microwavy tasting. The nice thing about this location is that it's on the 2nd floor of the epicenter and you can get there directly from the Aloft.\n\nThey have some very good deals on breakfast bagels that are CHEAPER than Smoothie King. Damn you delicious expensive smoothies!\n\nTip: I wasted $2 on a very very disgusting and watered down Iced Coffee. Avoid at all costs. Minus 1 star for that. I think this is the first time I have gained 5lbs from a salad. Nutrition facts are online but they seem underestimated. \n\nThe garlic cheese bread was a little too buttery and not doughy enough for my taste. \n\nThe sandwiches are gigantic!! The HALF grinder is 9\"... Crazy. I just want to start by saying that these 4 stars are alot deserved mostly due to that amazing complimentary cheese bread and bacon butter. Best way to start a meal.\n\n'APPS:\nJumbo Sea Scallops - GET IT. DEEEELlicious. Best appetizer of the night. Huge scallop wrapped in crispy proscuitto bacon and cooked just for the right amount of time. Comes with 2 pieces, but you can order a third.\n\nCrab Cakes - Didn't even think I liked crab, and this was good. Comes with 2, but you can order a third.\n\nMediterranean Platter - Just ok, and the pita seemed stale and like they were just microwaved. Comes with a variety of hummus, olive tapenade, etc..\n\nENTREES:\nOsso Bucco: The veal was so delicious. Sometimes restaurants who serve veal find the crappiest veal meat - how that is possible I don't even know. The sauce was a little too thick for my taste, but very good. My favorite entree of the night.\n\nBeef Tenderloin: The filet mignon here was not bad for a non-steak house. Topped with a strong cheese, with a side of risotto. Recommended.\n\nLamb: Too gamey, don't get it.\n\nDESSERTS:\nApple Tartin: Too mushy\n\nChocolate Lava Cake: Not lava-y enough.\n\nDolce Pineapple Cake: Too mushy.\n\nThey had live music playing on a Wednesday night, but the most entertaining part of the night was probably the fact that my 40 year-old waiter was hitting on my 2 male coworkers. \n\nGood entrees, good service, and really not as expensive as I thought it would be. I loved this place the first time, but I went back for Restaurant Week, and was incredibly disappointed.\n\nFisherman's Daughter Wild Shrimp and Cucumber Salad - NOTE: This is NOT a salad. It's 4 cocktail shrimp with sweetened tomato sauce and a shreds of cucumbers. Bleh.\n\nProsciutto Flat Bread - Had a really stinky fontina cheese and I felt the sage was too pungent. Also, I didn't like the quality of the flatbread.\n\nAlaskan Halibut with a Lobster Succotash - Most flavorless halibut I have ever had. Lobster cream sauce should never be flavorless! I added a boatload of salt, so it was somewhat bearable. \n\nThe Cake di Chocolate is standard lava cake (takes forever to make).\nThe Pecan Pie was HUGE. \nThe Sticky Toffee Pudding was very butterscotchy. \n\nOverall? Not a fan.\n\nMaybe if I come back next time I'll have better luck?", "user_id": "XTi7LJPw5_izQaMQF4cU1Q", "business_id": "ji0VxQpFQvzzYMy9fY5fvw"}
{"text": "Recently, I had a business lunch here and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Luce is a small restaurant that sits at the foot of the Hearst tower.  If you are not paying attention, it is possible that you might miss it; even if you are looking for it.  I have worked uptown for a while now and did not know it was even there until someone took me there.  In fact, when we were walking to Luce's I thought that maybe the people I was dining with meant Lavecchia's.\n\nRegardless, once I got there, I was impressed with the atmosphere.  It was small and well appointed.  I think this would be a good place for future business lunches or dinner.  A date might be nice here as well.  The dining room is dimly lit but not too dark and I swear all of the waiters are fresh imports from Italy. All are very attentive and have a strong Italian accent.\n\nWhile you wait for your meal, you are presented with fresh bread and olive oil with beans and some sort of spice, a  bruschetta of sorts, to munch on.  For lunch I had a pasta dish made of spinach pasta and a heavy cream sauce - an alfreto of sorts with prosciutto.  The flavors were amazing.  The dish had a certain richness to it but was very light.  Although I have not been to Italy before, I would suspect this to be very authentic.\n\nI was impressed by my experience at Luce's and look forward to returning again soon. I give the Tic Toc a full five stars because it has all the necessary ingredients for a great meal out: genuine character, good comfort food, cleanliness, and a cute older couple that runs the joint. Tic Toc is a really great hole in the wall diner that I know most people don't probably think twice about if they even notice it at all. The first time I visited was out of necessity for an impromptu business meeting.\n\nHonestly though, you are greeted by the owners when you go in (I think they are British), grab a mug (if you want coffee), and grab a seat. If you go here you should not expect everything to be new and shiny... instead, expect patina and charm. Even the mugs are a random collection similar to what you might see in a thrift shop - but it works for this place and I love it!\n\nThe food is standard diner fare but good nonetheless. They have a variety of specials offered throughout the week and I know other yelpers speak to how good they are but I have yet to venture out of my usual (eggs, toast, coffee). Regardless of what you get, one thing is for sure, Tic Toc is a great value.\n\nI'll be back! So I have eaten here a hand full of times and the food and service has always been out of this world. This is actually one of my favorite places to get fillet Mignon. Although, I have tried many other things on the menu though; like the wild boar - which will blow your mind. Regardless, I think you would be hard pressed to find bad food here. The only disappointment I have ever experienced with this place is that they serve Foie Gras. I am sure they make what is considered \"good foie gras\" but I just think it is cruel in terms of what they have to do to the poor duck/goose to make this dish. \n\nAs far as the feel of the place, although it is upscale, I find it to be a bit more casual than formal. With low light and deep tranquil colors, it is relaxing; setting a good stage for conversation. Another great date place in my book!", "user_id": "Ucs7mEaTTzLvpshSYZw7Iw", "business_id": "z24h6ZYnZiWjlDTuLXG9jw"}
{"text": "While I do revel in trendy, upscale, \"nouvelle cuisine\" type places, (and no, I did not just make that up...) I have to give credit where credit is due.\n\n\"We're going to Waldhorn for dinner.\"  \"A Wal what??\"--my reply.  Waldhorn is a German restaurant in the Matthews area.  It's not easy to drag me away from my comfort zip codes, but this turned out to be a treat.  \n\nNo frills here.  As other reviewers have noted, the \"investigation lighting\" was off putting.  If I have peppercorns in my teeth, I would rather find out about it after my meal.  Our waitress was super friendly and gladly dimmed the lights for us.  Nice, friendly staff! \n\nWe started with the bratwurst sausage appetizer plate and the \"Gebackenber Ziegenkase,\" which is goat cheese, spinach and sundried tomatoes stuffed in a phyllo dough pastry.  The sausage came with sauerkraut (I am a fan) and a spicy mustard.  I favored the smoked wurst and ate the spicy mustard until my sinuses were clear.  No Day Quil required!\n\nFor my entree, I wanted something straight up German.  I opted for the Sauerbraten.  This is a braised marinated beef dish served with spatzle and red cabbage.  I had never had spatzle, but it is a fettucini-esque noodle with more texture.  I loved the texture of these noodles.  The beef and gravy that it came with were delicious.  Tender and bursting with flavor.  \n\nOoh, and the beer I ordered (a wheat beer whose name I can't remember) came in a tall cylindrical glass that made me feel like something special!\n\nThe meal was hearty and delicious. Lots of male customers.  I wouldn't typically crave or think about this type of food, but for what it was, it was an enjoyable experience! I came here as a mother-daughter duo for Restaurant Week and was not disappointed. After reading some other reviews, I get the sense that there may be some *inconsistencies* but we were all pleased with our visit. \n\nWe all ordered from the pre-fixed menu. The petite filet was cooked to perfection and the cauliflower/leek puree was good enough to eat as a soup. Seriously. The Guinea Hen (I chose the dark meat option) was rich and flavorful. The braised swiss chard and honey roasted fingerling potatoes were the perfect pairing. I would never have thought to do the potatoes in sweet sauce. They were divine. \n\nOur server was so sweet and accommodating. Keep in mind that Savannah Red is more of a wine bar, so the liquor selection is limited. I had high hopes for the Krispy Kreme Makers Mark bread pudding, but it really missed the mark with all 4 of us. It was more like a Cinnamon roll with bourbon poured on top. I would definitely come back to experience the regular menu! Blue.  Your Friday night just got a lot more exciting! \n\nThe restaurant was busy, but not jam packed on an impromptu Friday night dinner date.  While we weren't dressed to the nines, they were ok with letting us in!  \n\nThere is a lot to choose from on the menu, but the way it is divided makes it much more navigable. It is divided into appetizers, mid courses, salads, cheese courses, entrees, and specials.  \n\nWe began with the Tega Hills bibb lettuce salad with warm duck confit, as well as the Moroccan Kefta meatballs.  The salad was scrumptious.  It was really working that whole sweet and salty thing.  Meatballs were not my pick, but WOW they were good.  Served with a charmoula sauce which is heavy on the garlic, parsley and cumin, in a very good way.\n\nPer our waitress' recommendation (who was GREAT by the way), I had the pan seared Australian sea bass.  It was served on top of a diced butternut squash with ginger brown butter.  It was light  yet decadent at the same time.  \n\nOur waitress gave great recommendations and was totally enthusiastic about the menu.  I love it when people get as excited about food as me. We really enjoyed our experience and would be back in a flash.", "user_id": "cZjX4HsWB8mTLHI4uhbB-g", "business_id": "2_0P2AmSSFtPgddio0MgYA"}
{"text": "So I've yet to go to the Waldhorn for lunch or dinner?  Why, then, am I reviewing it, you ask?\n\nThe answer: OMG brunch buffet.\n\nOk, so at $16 and change, the weekend brunch buffet isn't cheap. But it is plentiful and delicious. Omelettes are made to order (and made well, at that), and there smorgasbord of other selections: everything from pasta to rice to sausage to cake.\n\nOf special note are the sausages and the red cabbage. Especially the red cabbage. If you think cabbage can't be so good as to give you daydreams, well, you haven't had the cabbage here. Even a brunch attendee native to Germany agreed with me on that.\n\nThe staff is friendly and attentive (even though we were difficult and changed tables!) and the decor is entertaining.  The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because I haven't experienced a full-service meal here yet.  I suspect that is just a matter of time, however. Somehow my review got moved to the Yelp event page. Reposting here...\n\nEvery once in a while, you have an experience at a restaurant that's so lovely, you know you'll remember it for years. The meal we ate at the Capital Grille this week doubtlessly falls into this category.\n\nI know that Capital Grille is a chain, and an expensive chain as well. I'm not usually super excited about corporate steakhouses (Ruth's Chris: meh), and I usually wouldn't have chosen one for a Restaurant Week outing. However, Capital Grille treated us so well during the Yelp Generous Pour event, we decided to return. I'm glad we did: the food and the service were both amazing.\n\nI'll talk about the food first. Their Restaurant Week menu is not very varied: they offer three steak entrees and one salmon dish. However, I don't see that as a downside, since if you're looking for something lighter and/or vegetarian, you're not going to go to a steakhouse, anyways. For my entree, I ordered the Kona-encrusted sirloin with shallot butter.. oh my. This was a good steak, folks: tremendous flavor and perfectly cooked. I've learned that this steak is on their regular menu as well. This could be bad for my credit card. The appetizer of clam chowder was good, if not exceptional. My dessert of creme brulee was delicious. Nevertheless, it was all overshadowed by that steak.\n\nOk, now let's talk about the service. Yes, my steak was amazing, but you can get an amazing steak at other venues. What really set this night apart was the level of service we received. Even though it was Restaurant week, and even though we had nibbled and sipped for free the weekend before, we were treated as well as they could have treated any bank executive or local politician. Our waiter, James, was unobtrusively attentive and poured us multiple glasses of wine on the house. The manager checked in on us and shook our hands on the way out. I've never been treated better in a restaurant, especially when eating a meal at such a considerable discount.\n\nIn case you can't tell from the above, we really had a fantastic evening. I suspect that we'll be back the next time we have an excuse to splurge. Restaurant Week is a double-edged sword.  Restaurants either go all out, trying to impress you enough that you'll come back, or they just kind of schlep through it... and in that case, one must wonder why they even bother participating?\n\nBlue definitely falls into the going-all-out category.  I had been there once before for a non-Restaurant-Week meal, and I remember being impressed more by the ambiance than the food.  It's not that the food wasn't good: it just didn't stick in my memory like the swanky interior and live jazz did.\n\nWhen we returned for restaurant week, things were more equalized.  The interior remained swanky, and the jazz remained live, but I certainly remember the food this time.  Instead of making diners choose from a different menu, Blue merely marked certain regular offerings as eligible for RW.  Everything we ordered was delicious, especially the Scottish salmon.  To wash it all down, they make a mean martini.  Mmm mmm.  When you add in a fantastic waitress, what else can you ask for?\n\nThe only bit that keeps Blue from getting 5 stars is that we had to wait, even though we had a reservation.  I understand with was Restaurant Week and all, so even that is just a minor blip.", "user_id": "2KLg9BGxebym4neLPd9dNg", "business_id": "2_0P2AmSSFtPgddio0MgYA"}
{"text": "Went here on business trip for dinner. It was very good, fancy ritzy interior. The service is very helpful & friendly. The food is delicious. Everything was really fresh and made with care. \n\nHad the Salmone [Pistachio Crusted Salmon] and it was delicious. Cooked perfectly, great flavors. The fennel orange risotto was so good, unique taste. We also tried the sweet potato gnocchi. They were amazing. They were slightly crispy on the outside, sweet and savory. Also the white bean salad/dip that is put out with the bread is amazing. I would love to indulge by eating here again. The waitstaff is so very friendly, and super-attentive. The specials are always great & and the dessert is delicious. The menu has lots of options and changes frequently. I really enjoyed the perfectly cooked scallops with asparagus risotto. The custard was amazing. I really enjoy this restaurant and the friendly service. Lovely atmosphere, and creative dishes, located in the lobby of the Marriott. \n\nI was impressed by this restaurant, from the quiet setting with an uncrowded dining room to the casual friendliness of the waiters. And of course the beautiful and delicious food! The menu had a lot of options for a fancier place, and the dishes seemed to be quite unique - filet of elk, seafood, interesting complementing sauces and combinations. \n\nTwo types of complimentary cornbread (sweet and additionally peach & bourbon served with sweet kudzu butter) - yum! We started off with an appetizer, the ahi tuna with white chocolate foam and microgreens. it was very tasty, and was a decent sized portion for sure! I also enjoyed the warm lobster salad which was truly a piece of art to look at (a little awkward to eat) and very tasty - the flavors of everything blended well, I wish there were more greens though. For my entree I ordered a special - Yellow Fin Tuna with a grain of some sort and asparagus - I had it cooked medium, and it was great. There was just enough seasoning, but not too much to over power. The grains were mild and complimented the tuna. I would order it again. The people with me had the elk filet and were very pleased with their choice. \n\nOf course we had dessert. I opted for a dish with strawberries and kiwis with a marscapone ice cream. It was light, and maybe a little too sweet - but summery and fruity. The ice cream was great. The others ordered the crispy creme makers mark bread pudding and could not stop raving about it - so I would say go for it if that's your thing. \n\nOverall, I would go back. The bill was around 70 bucks a person, the service was great, and the food was very good.\n\nNote: their menu is out of date online Cool atmosphere, awesome food, great service, interesting menu - very impressed, and certain to return again!\n\nThe interior of Blue is aesthetically pleasing - dim lights, interesting floor set up, art on the walls, and live jazz. It feels fancy, but isn't overly intimidating. \n\nThe menu is decent sized, offering many options for appetizers, salads, and both seasonal entrees as well as year-round favorites. The beer list included some great options. The table started off Flavors of the Mediterranean - a hummus, baba ghanoush, olive tapenade, and white bean salad plate. There were also some stuffed grapeleaves (non-veggie) and a few goat-cheese stuffed peppadews served with pita bread - everything was delicious - very different flavors in each, amazing. I could have eaten the app as a meal. I think the olive tapenade was my favorite - just a very crisp and not over-salty flavor. I gave my grapeleaves away - but was told they were flavorful. The others ordered the Mussels with Chorizo and Piperade - and what a HUGE amount of mussels there were. I was told they were really good. They also served bread, a cranberry walnut and a cheese focaccia with an olive butter - this was also amazing. \n\nFor an entree I ordered the seasonal Alaskan Halibut. It was amazing. The fish was cooked perfectly (slight crisp to the outside, and tender inside) over crab, sweet fresh corn, red thumb potatoes, fava beans, and cherry tomatoes in a creamy corn broth - the flavors went very well together for an interesting dish. \n\nDessert was an amaretto dark chocolate cheesecake - it was good, not amazing. The consistency was a little drier than a cheesecake, and i wish it was a bit more chocolatey - but with the salted caramel the flavors slightly reminded me of a german chocolate cake. \n\nI will be back.", "user_id": "9DT-T93EOryicjJTib7UPQ", "business_id": "z24h6ZYnZiWjlDTuLXG9jw"}

{"text": "My husband and I checked out Mimosa Grill for the first time during Summer Restaurant Week here in Charlotte (which is still in process). We've seen the restuarant in passing and I work in the area so I see it while taking walks and never thought to go inside.\nWHAT HAVE WE BEEN WAITING FOR?? Is all I can say...\n\nOur first course included:\nHummus with veggies & olives plus grill pita bread\n&\nSeason Salad with FRESH tomatoes, carrots, etc..\nBoth were AMAZING, the Hummus was so tasty and the pita bread had a very nice char taste to it. The dressing on the salad was so GOOD that it made me want to rub my finger through the bowl and lick them :-)\n\nOur Main Course included:\nPecan Crusted Trout over mashed potatoes & haricot verts\n&\nHerb crusted Salmon over fresh sauteed sweet corn with cilantro and veggies.\nThere are no words to express how FRESH both entrees were and how many flavors were involved with each. They were both very pleasing to us.\n\nOur final Course Dessert:\nCheesecake\n&\nPeach Cobblese with BrownSugar Icecream\nWe are not big dessert eaters however my husband demolished the cheesecake which was pretty tasty, the peach cobbler crust was good (seeing that we both are not into cooked fruit, we just ate on the crust with the ice cream which was a SCORE)..\n\nI enjoyed my dinner so much that I walked over for lunch the next day and had a Hummus Wrap which was AMAZING. I really like this place, the only reason they didn't get a 5 STAR out of me is because I have to ensure they are consistent. Once visit doesn't amount to 5 stars, nor does two visits. I need to see them under pressure (service, cooks, etc..) so I will wait until I visit with a large group and see how fast, professional, and good the food is and if they pass I will update my review accordingly. Mehh that's my overall impression and experience. I expected to be a bit more impressed however I was underwhelmed with the food and the cleanliness. When I speak on cleanliness I am referring to the child high chair which was brought out to me at the seemingly upscale restaurant. I carry Wet Ones in my diaper bag because I disinfect high chairs before placing him into one BUT once I wiped the seat of this one my wipe was covered in old food and dirt Ewwww. What happened to chairs being cleaned by the restaurant after each use?\nThis was my second stop on my seven day restaurant week tour through the QC.\nI've been to Blue twice before once during the DNC & once during CIAA for a day party and both times I had a great time and only had drinks and passed foods that were flavorful.\n\nI started with the salad which was extremely small in size and not as big in flavor as o would've expected from the size however the presentation was great.\n\nMy main course was the NC trout which was good however nothing spectacular. The sauce atop was red and a bit spicy which was not a problem as I adore spice. \n\nDessert was THEE Highlight of the dinner as my neighbor talked me into Blue because she resides in Europe for years and LOVE Sticky Toffee pudding and saw that Blue was offering it for dessert.

{"text": "Greasy spoon in Belmont! Quick, cheap, and tasty :)  The type of place with loyal regulars.  Great country ham and eggs.  No muss, no fuss, just how a breakfast spot like this should be! Oktoberfest.  Live it.  Love it.  We've gone for my husband's birthday the past 2 years, and it has never failed to disappoint.  SO BUSY though, so book your reservations well in advance or you'll be waiting hours at the door.  The atmosphere is so fun and lively, and you wouldn't look a bit out of place in your lederhosen!  So drag it out of the closet!  I know you have a pair (a set?).  \n\nThe food is, as the other reviews say, wunderbar.  Unbelievable saurkraut.  Pretzel bites are the bomb.  Sausage sampler, exquisite.  They have a special menu for the fest, and I haven't been back to try the non-fest-fare, but it seems to me like anything you pick would be a winner.\n\nBut hands down the best part of Oktoberfest?  The accordion guy.  He is the jam.  He played the Pennsylvania Polka for us Steeler fans, and it was magical (sorry QC peeps, you won't get that, and it's okay).  Just give this guy some love because he's awesome.\n\nI'll post an update if I can ever make it back for Sunday Brunch! I've been to Mimosa probably 10 times in the past 2 years or so.  It's our go-to fancy lunch for new people at work.  Always great.  I've liked everything I've ever had there from the pecan crusted chicken to the asian salad.  Can't speak to the drinks (probably wouldn't be a good idea to slam cocktails at a work lunch), but the food and service is always great.  It's not my favorite place in the universe, the southern-y type places are just not my thing, but I can't deny that the food is deeeelish.\n\nTheir catering service is also pretty great, and they're very flexible with choices. As a frequent stop on our work \"lunch train\" (choo, choo), Arthurs is always my pick (over Showmar's, that is... because those are usually our only two options!).  If you're looking for a greasy, delicious, made-the-right-way reuben, Arthurs is your spot.  Crispy, buttery, bread with just the right amount of tangy sauerkraut, loaded with corned beef and balanced out with a dollop of thousand island.  Mmmmm.  It's also delish with turkey instead of the corned beef.\n\nI have a few gumbo connoisseurs in the office, and they all agree that Arthurs has the best chicken gumbo in walking distance of the Atrium.  As my co-worker put it \"If you see that Arthurs has the chicken gumbo as their soup of the day, you can't not get it.  Your lunch plans are made.\"  And it must be true, because I've tried to get it several times at around 1:30, and they are always out!\n\nI agree with the barrie h's comment to steer clear of the caesar salad, it leaves much to be desired, but for a good, hot sandwich and some tasty fries, Arthurs is the jam. Great Chinese/sushi.  Decent prices.  Quick and friendly service.  What more can you ask for a sit-down lunch joint?  General chicken is always a favorite, and with HUGE portions, you'll probably end up taking some to put in the work fridge for lunch tomorrow!  Sushi is fresh and yummy.  I wouldn't order a salad there, though.  I tried that route one time and was completely underwhelmed.  But that's what you get for ordering a salad at a Chinese restaurant!\n\nGreat choice for a quick, delicious sit-down lunch!

{"text": "This was probably one of the most anticipated sandwiches of my life. After seeing this place on Man v Food, I was determined to come here. Well on a business trip to Pittsburgh, I lightning bolted over to this place as soon as I got off the plane.\n\nPoint blank, this sandwich IS worth all the hype. As excited as I was, I was slightly skeptical about how fries and slaw would mix with some of the sandwiches. So I ordered the Pastrami sandwich which comes with the aforementioned on top... It was straight up unbelievable. Surprisingly, everything mixed perfectly together and the bread even stood out as being very good. \n\nIf you're a health conscience, then it makes absolutely no sense to come here at all. You're here for the most unhealthy and delicious sandwich you'll ever have, so keep that in mind. That being said, this is place is delicious and it's an absolute must when visiting Pittsburgh. Stopped at Merts on the recommendation of a client while visiting Charlotte. The food was pretty good, though not nearly as good as soul food I've had in other places. The collard greens were very good, but the fried chicken was a bit dry. I didn't come in with high expectations so I wasn't extremely let down, but I've definitely had better sold food at other  places. This is a really cool place in an awesome part of Charlotte. Came here for dinner and sat in their outside seating area. As with every place in Charlotte, the wait staff was awesome and incredibly friendly. \n\nFood wise, I ordered the lobster macaroni and cheese with an order of crab cakes. The lobster mac and cheese was very good, but I've had some pretty amazing mac n cheese from a few other places, so this definitely didn't measure up. The crab cakes were good as well. Nothing crazy, but very good. \n\nThe scene is a very cool with it being more of a young professional and after work crowd. Definitely would like to come back here during the day as it's probably much more enjoyable if sitting outside. Overall, very cool place. No matter where you are, you can always depend on a capital grille to be top notch in every aspect. Came here on a trip to Charlotte, and just like every other capital grille experience, it was pretty much perfect. \n\nI had a card for a free appetizer from a capital grille in Philly, so I was able to to use it at the Charlotte location for a free appetizer. I ordered the calamari and as always it was delicious. In addition to this they give you a plate full of freshly made potato chips that are delicious. Between both of these it made for a perfect happy hour along with their awesome rum selection.\n\nThe service at this location was extra good being that there was a hint of southern hospitality added to an already great service experience. The bartender was quick, attentive and kept the drink glass full after seeing I was getting low. Great experience and I look forward to visiting the next Cap Grille in a different city. Came to Fujo for a quick lunch in between meetings as I was in the mood for some sushi. They sat me at the bar area and were very attentive as I mentioned I was looking to be in and out as quickly as possible. \n\nWhen it comes to sushi I'm a big shrimp tempura fan, so I asked if they could specifically make that roll for me with just shrimp and asparagus. They were very accommodating and had the roll made within 10 minutes during what was a pretty busy lunch period. The roll was good, but definitely nothing special compared to other sushi places. The service was great though and they have a great lunch menu that's everything under 10 dollars. \n\nSolid place with good sushi but nothing mind blowing.", "user_id": "t2CJ8v_BvhxrC291ZWnRSg", "business_id": "NeUf9FyCCIN4MEseNyqkXQ"}
{"text": "I give this place 5 stars for the extraordinary service. They make repeat customers feel like cherished friends. The sesame tofu is the best I've had in Charlotte. Breaded and super crispy... Yum! 3.5 stars.  Nothing special, but everything was fairly well done.  Went for a lunch meeting and had the southwest salad.  The jalapeno ranch was made in house and was great.  The baguette on the side was a nice touch.  Service was perfect: attentive but not hovering.  We were able to get in and out quickly.  Other diner thought the ahi tuna salad was good as well.  Tuna was perfectly done and contained a good sized lunch portion.  Other meals (chicken avocado sandwich and bacon cheeseburger) looked uninteresting. This is a very expensive dinner, which for me means it is a special occasion only place.  The food was delicious, and the service friendly and professional.  The only complaint I have regarding service is that they gave us so much time between each visit to the table, the dinner lasted a full 3 hours.  We were hungry and would loved to have gotten our meals sooner!  But I also appreciate that we were given privacy to enjoy each course.  \n\nThe portions are adequate but on the small side compared to other restaurants, which is typical for a high end restaurant.  The food itself was delicious.  We tried the CAPRESE SALAD, which contained two slices of tomato and two slices of mozzarella with a bit of basil and balsamic.  The tomatoes were of excellent quality.  I was happy that there was bread on the table to bulk up the appetizer a bit.  We also ordered the PROSCIUTTO and ASPARAGUS, which contained high quality ingredients and was well seasoned.    \n\nOne of the evening specials was a BRANZINO with SEA BASS.  My coworker enjoyed this dish, but it looked a little messy as the fish was thin and flaking all over the plate.  Another coworker ordered the GNOCCHI and said it was excellent.  I had the RAVIOLI, which consisted of fresh house made pasta filled with mozzarella and ricotta in a delicate tomato sauce.  It was just enough to satisfy my hunger, but this would not be enough for a hungry or heavy eater.  The fresh pasta was unexpected but wonderful.  \n\nWe asked for wine suggestions, and ended up with a full bodied red from BRUNELLO DI MONTALCINO that was still light and had no sharpness.  I'm not a fan of red wine, but even I enjoyed this one. \n\nWe had 3 entrees, 2 appetizers and a bottle of wine for $235 + tip. Overall, I find Fujo to be fairly average, but it's convenient and if you know what to order you can get a good meal.  \n\nYou can ask for all white meat in your chicken dish, so if you have a problem with weird, inedible black pieces of meat in your GENERAL's or SESAME CHICKEN, specify all white meat and that problem goes away. \n\n I've ordered GENERAL's and SESAME TOFU many times in varying ways, but finally realized that this dish is not going to work for me here.  They cut the tofu into very large triangles and fry (without any breading).  So you get a tough, extremely hard edged piece of tofu to try to chew.  Inevitably you will not be able to chew it properly, sobeware of throat lacerations if you try to swallow it.  I've tried to order it in smaller pieces (didn't work), and less fried (also a fail).  \n\nI recently discovered their EGGPLANT with GARLIC SAUCE.  It's actually very good, as long as the eggplant pieces are cut small enough.  The sauce is very flavorful, and they'll even make it with less oil upon request.  \n\nI know several people who love the noodle dishes, and it does seem to be a lot of food for a decent price.  The service here is quick and efficient.  You can get in and out at lunch time in 30 minutes or less.  If you get your order to go, check the bag to see if you have enough soy or other sauces.  I find that 2 packets of soy aren't enough for me, so I always have to ask for extra.", "user_id": "I9-qaI_sfTJzeG52WZMdkQ", "business_id": "rT-iPtIXMKj3dTcl87lbOw"}
{"text": "When my parents arrived in town late and said they wanted to eat somewhere close by, I knew this was my chance to finally show them this little 4th Ward hidden gem. And to think, they had proposed a nearby pub.\n\nWe went around 8:00 on a Thursday and had to wait about 15 minutes for a table, but the time flew by as we had some beers at the bar. We were seated right in the middle of the restaurant, which, with the candlelit tables, felt very intimate.\n\nThis was my second time here. I really enjoyed the Feta Chicken last time, and this time I went with the What It Is (blackened chicken breast over fresh rotini in a Cajun cream sauce). It was amazing! The portion was generous and it was just the right amount of spicy. I reluctantly shared some with my parents and they agreed it was heavenly.\n\nThis place is perfect for everyone. I was there with my parents and I noticed tables of guy friends, girl friends, and plenty of people on dates. No reason not to check this place out, especially if you live in 4th Ward. Came for the first time during restaurant week. Impressively, it stayed open during the ice storm when many other restaurants shut down.\n\nI ordered the Arrancini (first course), jumbo scallops and short rib (entree), and the sticky toffee pudding (dessert). The Arrancini and dessert were both good but the scallops and short rib really stood out the most. The portions were quite generous, especially by restaurant week standards. \n\nOur server was fast, attentive, and friendly, but he struggled with the cocktails a bit. He mixed up our garnishes and forgot to put the bleu cheese-stuffed olives in my friend's martini. This may not sound like a big deal, but when you're paying $10+ per drink, you don't want to have a cinnamon rim instead of a cucumber.\n\nDespite the cocktail issue, we had a very pleasant experience overall. If you're looking for a good meal uptown for restaurant week, definitely give Blue a try. In an attempt to rid myself of the bad taste left by some dreadful airport sushi I had the other day, I was eager to get back to my favorite sushi place in Charlotte. I played it safe and went with my two favorite specialty rolls: the Philly Melt and the Hot Lava. \n\nFujo's Philly Melt is my favorite cream cheese roll I've ever had...it just melts in your mouth. Still, my very favorite overall is the Hot Lava roll. I swear, I would bath in the hot lava sauce if I could. Although not quite big enough to accommodate an adult male body, it is pretty huge and I've been known to dip other rolls in what's left over.  \n\nI always tell myself to try some of the other specialty rolls but I can't bring myself to pass on my two faves...It might require me to develop a new allergy to shrimp or cream cheese.

I arrived around 6:00 and there were only two couples there. Needless to say, I was seated immediately and was waited on by like 3 different people. The service was very good and very fast...I think they refilled my water like 5 times in the half hour I was there. \n\nI wanted to try some rolls I've never had, so I ordered the Tokyo, Godzilla, and Sunset rolls. The Tokyo roll was unique in that it was fried and then re-rolled in rice. The Godzilla roll was delicious but it was pretty similar to the Philly Melt, which I prefer because of the cream cheese. The Sunset roll was my favorite because of the yummy garlic sauce. By using a Groupon, I got all three rolls for less than $20 after tax and tip. Not bad at all!\n\nUPDATE: Ordered the Magician's Roll, Cajun Roll, and the Panther Roll. Of the three, the Panther Roll was my favorite, which is hard for me to admit given that I'm a Giants fan and I hate Cam Newton. My least favorite was the Magician's Roll, although it did look pretty amazing with all the colorful caviar. I ordered the Cajun Roll because I've never had crawfish in sushi and the cajun spice sounded intriguing, but it wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped.", "user_id": "mrK0DHf8H4VWJQAidKL3bA", "business_id": "ePP0Eqz8JKSbtdt2phiB4A"}
{"text": "I really like a place where you can customize your burger and this place had turned that into an art.  There are an infinite number of ways to to get your burger done.  Plus they don't just have burgers, there are a ton of other options that are just as tasty.  They have a very impressive selection of beer too, so if you like adventure in that area give it a go.  It tends to get a little crowded around lunch time with all the bankers and whatnot, but still worth the trip. When I walked into this place I felt like I was walking into my dad's favorite bar in my hometown.  It was very casual and laid back, with the big wooden chairs and comfortable atmosphere.  The food was about the same as the bar back home too.   Good but not spectacular.  It tasted very fresh and well cooked, but pub food is rarely worth getting too excited about.  The waitress was very attentive and took good care of us.  She really wanted us to have a good time. This place was cool because it uses locally grown food in all it's dishes, which means the menu changes from season to season.  And that's cool with me because the traditional southern fare is fantastic.  Everything my friends and I had was cooked to perfection and there was a lot of it too.  \n\nA little on the pricey side, but not to terribly bad.  The only real down side was the service.  Now we might have caught them on a bad day, but the waitress seemed rushed and we had to flag her down if we needed something.  Other than that though, it was a good experience. This the most ultramodern, upscale place I've been to in a long time.  This little place is tucked away inside the Marriott City Center and is a really treat to go to.  Very high class, boldly decorated and has some awesome food.  It's expensive (as you would expect) but it's worth it. The veal was a mouthwatering experience to say the least.  The servers were very impressive, they were very attentive and you could tell they really wanted us to have a good experience.  But the best part of the meal is always the dessert and I have four words for you, Krispy Kreme bread pudding.  That is all. Very swanky place, kind of reminds me of Blue Fin in Atlanta.  It has a very modern design to it with nice wood floors and metal sculptures of fish hanging from the ceiling.  It's all very impressive.\n\nThe food is to die for as well.  A great wine selection and food cooked to perfection.  The signature dish is the lobster, but I've always liked shrimp better.  It's a very nice experience to try. This place specializes in down home cooking.  They are famous for their fried chicken and I definitely recommend trying it.  They also have a variety of other foods to choose from if you're more health conscious that myself.  Definitely one to try for your next long lunch hour. I unfortunately have not been able to make it to this fine establishment for any meal other than breakfast.  But let me tell you it was well worth dragging my tired butt out of bed and heading to my sucky job early so that I could swing by this place.\nThe employees are friendly and welcoming even at 7am, and they have the hot coffee ready to go.  I'm not usually a fan of the breakfast sandwiches with egg on them, but I gave one from this place a try and actually liked it.  They use really fresh stuff, and the eggs were nice and fluffy.

{"text": "Went for the first time last night, but have been hearing about this place for years.  Passing by I always thought this was an Italian place because of the name Tony Roma's but its more of a Steakhouse with a little bit of everything, and known for there Ribs.  Strangely enough I ended up getting a pasta dish....lol. I had the Chicken Pasta Linguine which was new to menu.  I have to say it was quite yummy.  My friends had the Ribs of course, and said they were outstanding.  The atmosphere of the restaurant was good, and the waitress was very attentive. I don't see myself coming back anytime soon, but definitely would go if someone else recommended it. So I FINALLY made it to the Melting Pot.  A group of 6 of us went last night for Restaurant Week (which I highly recommend - $30 per person for 4 courses).  I have always heard great things about the Melting Pot and have been wanting to try it out for the longest time.  The hostess and the waitresses were both amazing.  They were really good and patient with us considering it was our first time there, and we all had no clue what we were doing.  \n\nWe started out with the Appetizer course.  We got to pick 2 types of cheeses for dipping our Bread, apples, and fresh vegetables.  We chose the Wisconsin Trio & the Fondue a la France.  I think the consensus was that the Wisconsin Trio was better, but they both were delightful. Next we all got to pick a salad.  I chose the Caesar.  Next we moved onto our Entrees.  We either got to choose between... \n\nThe Coastal which included blackened scallops, cedar plank salmon, breast of chicken, teriyaki sirloin, white shrimp, and spinach & artichoke ravioli  \n\nor\n\nThe French which included filet mignon, chicken Provencal, roasted garlic shrimp, peppercorn NY Strip, ratatouille & goat cheese ravioli, and asparagus\n\nSince there was 6 of us in the party, 3 of us chose The Coastal, and 3 of us chose The French so we could just taste and mis-match them all.\n\nThey give you the choice of two kinds of dipping broth to use to cook all of your entrees.  We chose the Coq au Vin and Court Bouillon. I personally enjoyed the filet mignon, chicken Provencal, goat cheese ravioli, teriyaki sirloin, and spinach & artichoke ravioli.\n\nAfter all this, we moved on to the Dessert course. We got to choose two types of Chocolate dipping sauces.  First was the DISARONNO\u00ae Meltdown which is Silky white chocolate swirled with Disaronno\u00ae Originale Amaretto and second was the Flaming Turtle which is Milk chocolate, caramel and chopped pecans.  Yum Yum and more Yum!!!  They are served with cheesecake, pound cake, brownies, marshmallows, Rice Krispies treats, bananas and strawberries.\n\nAfter all that I think we were all ready to take a big nap.... and were busting at the seams of our pants!!! Haha.  I have to say I highly recommend this place, not just for the amazing food, but the experience.  This was a 3 hour dinner that seemed like an hour.  The laughing and the fun of cooking and dipping your own food was so enjoyable.  This place is great for a good group of friends or even a date night between two people.\n\nAnd just one more thing... Since your cooking the food right at your table, your going to smell like your food, so I highly recommend not wearing clothing that isn't easy to wash into the Melting Pot, and also leave your jacket in your car..... lol.", "user_id": "S2OY1vzzJjMnVrCkdoaujQ", "business_id": "QMZe84KFyZy0IlCBb1v91A"}
{"text": "We just went here last night because of charlotte restaurant week and wanting to try a different upscale restaurant.  The experience was nothing close to nice or upscale.  We arrived and were promptly seated by a friendly hostess, A+ to the hostesses.\n\nIt took some minutes before our waiter came to us, friendly, but slow.  Kevin and I both ordered our appetizers, meal, and dessert all at once, along with a drink from the bar.  Kevin ordered soup and I ordered a salad.  Kevins soup came, no salad for me.  The server came by with bread and did not say a thing.  My salad finally arrives.  A few minutes later the server returns and mentions she is glad to see that I have my salad now and was wondering what happened to it.  Both the soup and the salad were good, but to eat starters separately should not happen.  After finishing, I finally get my bar drink, the server appologizes for it taking so long.\n\nNext to courses.  Kevin had lobster pasta and I had steak.  My steak was dropped off, but no steak knife was dropped off by our waiter, the person who dropped off the food, or anyone.  Waiter no where in sight, I flag down someone for a steak knife.  Aside from that, the steak was good, had a nice flavor.  Kevin liked his, but did not think it was anything special.\n\nWe finish the main course and are waiting around for some time, our waiter comes by and asks us if we want boxes, we say yes.  A couple minutes later a guy comes by with our desserts. He asked us of we were still working on our dinners, suprised to see them on the table.  We told him we were waiting on boxes.  He takes them away to box them.  A few minutes later our waiter comes with boxes, and is surprised to see our food gone.  Aside from that, the desserts were good.  The chocolate cake was rich, but great!\n\nOverall, I was not blown away by the food, and since the service and experience was awful, I will not be back.  If I'm going to pay a lot of money for dinner, it should all be great.  It was just like going to a mediocre restaurant, felt nothing like an upscale restaurant. I have been here three times, just recently during Charlotte Restaurant week.  I absolutely love this place, obviously don't come often, as it is pricey but you get a lot of food!  It doesn't seem like much, but when you get a four course meal, the little stuff adds up quickly!  Plus you can always ask for as many extras as you want with the cheese and chocolate fondues for no extra charge.  So be prepared to eat alot and leave stuffed!\n\nDuring my lastest adventure to the Melting Pot, I called to ask for reservations and asked for a little more private or secluded booth as to not be out in the open and enjoy a nice romantic dinner.  They delivered, put us upstairs in a booth secluded from others.  The staff there always seems very nice, knowledgable, and just great all around.  Great Service! \n\nThe Cheese, I've had the fiesta, spinach artichoke, and one of the specials they were running.  Fiesta was definitely my favorite, but I liked them all.  Can't go wrong with cheese!\n\nSalads, I've had the house, ceasar, and spinach salads.  All good, but I think I prefer their caesar.  They do put some kind of garlic or some kind of seeds in their ceasar salads - something different, but good!\n\nMeats and Cooking - all have been good for the most part.  Although this last time, I didn't care for how their chicken was flavored, I enquired about it, and it actually had a hint of chocolate on it! We have always upgraded our cooking style, coq a vin is what I've had two of the three times and I really like it, especially with the flavoring of the vegetables.\n\nNow onto the chocolate.  That of course is my favorite.  I love to dip the strawberries, rice krispy treats, and cheesecake with the chocolate!  I would have never thought of rice krispy treats, but they are just delightful!  Even have asked for extra of those!  My favorite chocolate hands down is the turtle - chocolate with caramel and nuts, yummy! \n\nI can't wait until my next visit!", "user_id": "31D7Vgfk3RPaePdkMBSyCw", "business_id": "TLrX4FECQDFz-E45TI_9ow"}
{"text": "Tucked away on the outskirts of uptown/downtown Charlotte sits the cute and quaint Alexander Michael's. While my best friend and his boyfriend were in town for the holidays, we decided to stop in here for a bite to eat.  It was after 1 PM & surprisingly, the place was still packed.  This isn't saying much, because the tavern is quite small. Luckily, there were some empty seats at the bar.\n\nThey have a pretty extensive lunch menu & everything sounds good! I had a hard time choosing, but I went with the burger & cajun fries. (My second choice was the grilled cheese - maybe next time!)\n\nWe didn't wait too long until our food arrived. Holy cow (pun intended), this burger was HUGE! There were plenty of fries, too!  The burger was so tasty. It was just the right amount of juicy, without said juicy running down your wrists & arms. The bun from local Nova's Bakery was a fantastic addition. Word of caution: you will have to cut this burger in half!  Needless to say I finished my entire burger...it was only right! I wasn't able to finish the fries, but they were hot & crispy & the cajun seasoning had just enough \"bite\"...it wasn't overpowering.\n\nThe staff was so friendly & chatted frequently with us. They always made sure our glasses were filled & that we were enjoying our food. \n\nThe prices are a bit pricey, but in my case, the portion equaled the price ($9).\n\nI'll definitely be back! I'm ok with Morton's, it surely doesn't come to mind when I think of an upscale steakhouse, if I want to go to one.\n\nThe portions are huge, which is a good thing considering how pricey they are.  The filet mignon single cut is tasty, the chopped salad delightful & the saut\u00e9ed spinach & mushrooms are to die for!\nOh & of course dessert, the very refreshing mixed berries.\n\nThe wait staff are very attentive & the one night I went, our waitress went a little overboard.\n\nThe ambiance is nice & intimate & I love that it's two story. GOOD food! I recommend the salmon cakes, greens, mac n cheese. Their cornbread is amazing, as well!\nThe ambiance is something out of an old soul's home...amazing pictures of celebrities who've been in town & the soul music overhead is so good!\nThe staff is friendly & attentive.\nKeep in mind, they stay pretty busy for lunches & dinners.\nWhat's REALLY good is their New Year's brunch, every Jan. 1st. $20 for all you can eat buffet! Another spot on my list of consistency... :D\n\nThis is in a prime location for me before any event at Time Warner Cable Arena. I go in, order my always delicious Bronx Bomber pizza, eat & am on my way. Maybe the staff is trained in knowing who's in a hurry vs. those that have no where to be.\n\nMy pizza always comes out perfect. The thin crust is never burnt, toppings are plentiful & well distributed. The sauce is light, which is extremely important to me.\n\nYes, it's crowded & thankfully has a mix of people between the downtown workers, sports fans, families, couples, or groups.\n\nService is quick & friendly. I really love Melting Pot! The concept is exciting enough, but then all the food, too?! \nHere's what I normally go with - the four choice classic:\n\n- Wisconsin Trio Cheese Fondue - oh my...I could just eat the cheese by itself! :D However, it does come with vegetables, granny smith apples & various bread for dipping. \n\n- Spinach mushroom salad - the spinach & mushrooms always look fresh & that Shallot Vinagrette dressing is so yummy!\n\n- Entree (cooked in the coq au vin style) of ahi tuna, shrimp, sirloin, chicken breast & teriyaki-marinated sirloin. \n\n- Dessert - Flaming turtle. This is just like the turtle candy; chocolate, caramel & chopped pecans. Of course, you get strawberries, bananas, cheesecake, Rice Krispie treats, marshmallows, pound cake & brownies. \n\nWow! So much food, but so worth it. \nYes, it's pricey, so you may want to save this \"big night out\" for special occasions.\n\nThis location is the \"older\" one in Charlotte & not really my favorite one of the two Charlotte locations.\nI've been to this one twice & haven't had any issues - both times I had reservations & they were on time.

{"text": "For 9 years, i have lived only 3 miles away from the best brunch in town. I just realized this a day ago.  Made to order omelets, roast beef carving station,  salad/soup, potato salad, brats, sausages, pork, pretzel rolls, bacon, more pork, veggies, french toast, grits and other normal breakfast fare, rice, pasta, chicken, apple/cherry cobbler, tons of deserts....oh my the deserts. Everything was very very good. It was very hard to force myself to stop eating and when we left i could barely move.\nSome may think its a little pricey but at $17/ per person it is way worth it for the selection and quality of food. Another great thing is that its not predominantly just breakfast foods. There is something for everyone. I thought the service was awesome. Our server and the guys at the roast beef/omelet station all told me about their Oktoberfest and encouraged me to attend. Guess i look like i really dig beer (well, it's true). \nI'm not sure what additionally i can say that previous reviews haven't already said...ill just echo that if you haven't been to this brunch yet-your definitely missing out! Grub wise, Jason's deli is pretty affordable and the food is decent. No complaints there. The to-go process makes me want to bang my head against a wall tho. About once a month everyone at work decides \"lets have Jason's  for lunch\". I am the person who gets to make this happen. \nFirst time i saw they offered delivery \"Sweet, right?\" Um no, Its like $8 extra for delivery. Which they don't tell you over the phone. Not cool. On this occasion the money collection at work wasn't adding up so i had to call for itemized sammich prices and only then was i told about the delivery charge. They did wave it since they had neglected to mention it but $8 to deliver 1 mile, no thank you, not doing that again.\nSo now i call everything in and pick it up myself...not once out of roughly 20 orders has everything actually been correct. Dressings for salads have been left out, menu items missing and sometimes haven't even made it on to the ticket...requests for extra pickles ignored. It's an uphill battle with this place. So, its not to be obnoxious but i have to take everything out before i leave and verify all the food is there. Ive been conditioned. My advice is anyone picking up a to-go order is to do the same.\nLike i said, the food is actually pretty good but honestly i don't think grabbing a few sandwiches and salads need to be so difficult. Awesome $20 (including drink) Sunday brunch that not only includes the normal stuff (eggs, bacon, sausage etc...) but also offers about 8 small tapas plates such as southern style eggs benedict, mini omelets and walnut crusted french toast at no additional cost. There is also no limit to how many mini plates you can order. Its all included in the price:) Also noteworthy was the mac and cheese, green beans, sausage gravy and biscuits, various cheeses, glazed ham and heavenly dessert selection complete with chocolate covered strawberries. A few of the breakfast staple items on the buffet were just ok. A bit better bacon would earn them 5 stars from me.  Still, I say it would  be a damn shame to go somewhere like Ihop, when for a few bucks more you can have an epic brunch here. I dig the melting pot, i mean, its fun. Fondue=fun. This was another  \"Yay my birthday is during restaurant week!\" dinner for me. The cheeses, meat course and salad are good but lets be honest that dessert is where its at. Id get all 3 courses as dessert if i could.   A big pot of chocolate and then cheesecake, rise crispies, bananas, strawberries, red velvet cake and marshmallows all to dip into it. Heavenly is an understatement. \nI also dig that your in control of your own cooking times. So what if i cook my steak for 10 seconds...rare is good yo...\nGoing with a large group is smart. Then you can really sample a lot of the stuff on the menu. Our party had 8 peeps in it so we got 3 different cheeses, cooking styles and  chocolates. Service was aiiiiiight considering it was a large party, but it coulda been better. I normally wouldn't be able to afford more than one course here but at $30 for everything during restaurant week it's a hella great deal.", "user_id": "vjtZgqDr0ablgUxscqzOhQ", "business_id": "2_0P2AmSSFtPgddio0MgYA"}
{"text": "We came here for a working lunch with 5 people. The service although she was very nice was slow. Our food was also timed very poorly with half of it coming out about 10 minutes before the other half. I got the shrimp kebabs with green beans and rice. The food was good, but the shrimps were kind of on the small side. They put 2 together to make them look larger on the skewer. \n\nThe biscuits, like most people know, are the best part. What should have been a 45 minute lunch took around 1.5 hours, although the restaurant looked pretty empty. A Burger King is a Burger King, no more no less. \n\nThis location is off of Pineville Matthew rd near Carolina Place Mall and where I get my car serviced. Missing lunch at work the Friday of Memorial Day weekend, and just hanging out while getting my oil changed, I mosied on over here to grab some food. \n\nThere was a line, to be expected at lunch time. When I ordered my food I got a chicken nugget kids meal. I told the cashier I wanted fries and a soda because it says there's an option of fries or apple slices and soda or juice or milk. She said \"yes I know that's what you get with a meal\". Ok, I thought there were options, so I specified, is what I thought. What I said was \"ok\". \n\nI waited for my food for a good 10 minutes while they were making new fries, not a big deal, because like I said, I would have just been sitting at the car place. When I got back to the mechanic and sat down my chicken nuggets were old. Sad but true, the best part of my meal, despite the fries being \"fresh\" was the half diet Coke, half Cherry Diet Coke, that I got to mix together because they have one of those really fun Freestyle Coke machines. I came here with a group of friends before going to the Checkers game, a group of 6 people. We were sat in a booth that was a little cramped, but the place was busy so we didn't mind. \n\nBeing an after work event, our group got there in 3 waves. From the time we sat down until the last person got there was probably 10 minutes. The waitress was so impatient. As soon as the last person sat down she came over and asked if we knew what we wanted to eat. Well... yes some of us that had been there knew, but the one who just sat down (my husband) had not even had the chance to look at the menu. \n\nFrom there it only went downhill. I got the impression she was angry with us because she was just not very nice. She didn't come back to the table after that for 20 minutes. I got the Fresh House Made Mozzarella Sandwich and it was just a sad sandwich. It sounded so good, but the ingredients were wimpy. There wasn't enough tomato (which were not ripe) to cover the bread, and there were maybe 2 shreds of onion. There was nothing fresh about it. \n\nI also ordered an Angry Orchard Cider (not on the menu) which I had to ask if there were any ciders. The waitress did not say the price but beware they are $5.75. Too expensive in my mind for that drink (but what could I do at that point?). \n\nThe location is convenient, but I would much rather go to Queen City Q. My husband and I have been here on multiple occasions including restaurant week and have always had an amazing time. On this occasion we went with another couple who have never been to the Melting Pot before. We were super excited because we always leave full and happy. \n\nWe made a reservation for 5 pm, on Saturday, the first weekend of restaurant week. It took 15 minutes to be seated, which is a bit out of character for them, but considering the day and the weekend, it was understandable. \n\nWe were seated In a booth upstairs with one burner, which is a mistake with two parties - if you are going with two couples request two burners, it will make your life so much easier. \n\nWe got the cheddar cheese fondue, the pacific meal, and we made our own chocolate, the dark chocolate swirled with peanut butter. The food itself was very good, but I think our waiter was new and did not know how to balance all of his tables. \n\nWe had to ask for more food several times. You can ask for more bread and apples for example until all of your cheese is gone and vegetables and dips during the dinner (meat) portion. We were getting enough of the main part of each course but only enough of the secondary parts like the vegetables and bread and such for half of our group. During the meat part we had to ask another Melting Pot employee for more vegetables and dip because we had given up on our waiter ever bring anything back...we had asked him 20 minutes prior. \n\nOur waiter also turned the burner on too high the entire time, and very rarely explained anything to us, including the dips and the batter during our meat course. I understand that we had been there before, but our friends hadn't. And they didn't get to hear all of the fun things to do with dips like fill the mushrooms with the green goddess, or that the plums sauce is good on the shrimp, or if you mix curry and plum it makes a delicious new sauce. \n\nI think the takeaways from this meal was to 1. Always get at least one burner per couple, 2. Make sure your burners are always on the appropriate heat setting because it will burn your food, and 3. If you are going during prime dining time during restaurant week be prepared to be patient.\n\n***Update. Not even an hour after this review the manager, Steven called me to go over my review and to chat in order to improve their business. I think this is awesome! Remember how I said we had asked another employee for more veggies and dips? It was him! He was amazing and had even tried to see if they had an extra two burner table at the beginning of the meal. With people like him the Melting Pot will always be in business.", "user_id": "MWNSECOpcxO0UrZPqT8p5Q", "business_id": "BO0zz8gort7o-6KuecIv3Q"}
{"text": "We decided to change-up our Ruth's Chris experience with another high rated steakhouse. Just like any night out to dinner we dressed up with a nice top and jeans, which happened to be the wrong style for the hostess at Morton's. After checking in with the girl at the front an unnamed judgmental man who sat us at our table made a judgmental comment \"Oh jeans I see...\" making both my girlfriend and I uneasy and uncomfortable about the rest of our experience. \n\nThe drinks were average and the steaks were good, but not fabulous. In fairness, our waiter was very friendly, though.\n\nUnfortunately, our friendly waiter was not enough to overcome our bad initial impression.  I expected better, especially at a nice restaurant like this.\n\nWhen people are attempting to come into your establishment and spend over $150 on dinner, you should do whatever you can to make them feel as comfortable as possible.  Now I am sure never to return back to Morton's and I tell everyone I know about my negative experience. We went to Ri-Ra's for lunch and then for dinner.  The appetizers and sandwiches are really good, but the entree we had was pricey and did not have much flavor.\n\n\nWe did order some drinks, but there was little to no evidence that alcohol was actually included in our drinks....well played Ri-Ra's.\n\nWith that said, I would still come back here for a sandwich and some apps. Location hurts this place. It's fun to sit outside and watch what North Tryon has to offer the first couple times going here, but it loses its luster. \n\nNo complaints, but nothing stands out here. Definitely hidden. They serve good brunch on the weekends and you won't wait in a ridiculous line full of degenerates.   Make sure to get their biscuits. Dinner food is high quality/fresh and the recipes are interesting.\n\nFresh pear butter and biscuits were a nice bonus. We were very excited to find out that Blue was open the Friday of a snowstorm, since we had made reservations with our friends for restaurant week.\n\nLuckily the restaurant was not packed because of the storm which is always a plus during restaurant week. Our waiter came by to take our order for drinks and we all hopped on the fancy martini train. As we waited, a fresh batch of bread and butter came out. I would come back to this place for the bread and butter by itself. \n\nHere's where it got a little strange. Our waiter came back and accidentally poured the wrong alcohol in the wrong glass ( understandable, mistakes happen). So a cucumber martini into a cinnamon rimmed glass. He noticed his mistake right away, but instead of taking it back to the bar he said, \"maybe it'll taste good\" or something to that extent. Anyway, the drink was good after I wiped away the cinnamon rim.\n\nThe risotto balls were a little bland, but had a very crispy texture. The pork osso bucco was meh, as was the ravioli.\n\nHowever, the sticky toffee pudding was to die for. We will not seek this place out but wouldn't mind coming back for dessert, bread and butter! We have been here a number of times, and I have enjoyed it more and more each time.  We have gotten such phenomenal service.  Our last server was great and allowed us to tweak anything we wanted in terms of substitutions and omissions.\n\nWhat I love best about the place is that dinner is an experience and you get to relax and enjoy the large variety of food in your own personal little section.\n\nThe prices are very high, so we do not go here much, but this is a staple for restaurant week.", "user_id": "h6ANB0LnT4vAELRSj_uAOg", "business_id": "Lt9o2RmacVY2L-IWLA8uTg"}
{"text": "First time trying NY Pizza Express tonight, and I am very glad I did! \nFound a menu online to have a look at prices, very reasonable, actually I was surprised at how cheap they were. We order 2 large pies, one just mozz, the other sausage & bacon, for delivery on a Saturday evening. They gave us a 30-40 min time estimate, and were in my driveway no more than 20 minutes later! Good friendly service both on the phone, and from the delivery driver. \nPizza was great, nice slightly chewy crust, thin, but  not too thin. Good amount of sauce, and cheese tasted very fresh! It was really good. Super happy to have tried this place, now I just need to try their subs, calzones, and everything else! \nThanks NY Pizza Express! I have to defend this local BK as it has gotten of a lot of bad reviews.(not saying they were not called for)\nBut as of moving to Stallings and having this as the closest quick fast food they are not bad at all.\nWe have gotten to know the crew, don't know if that helps, but everything is fresh, hot, and never a messed up order. \nThe burger buns even look like the commercial and not squished!!\nOverall good experience, will return for sure. Let me preface this by saying I only came here because I was given a gift card. After reading the reviews I was less than excited, but hell, it was going to be free! \nGot to the restaurant around 4:45 for an early dinner. Walked in, there were about 5 parties sitting in a very full waiting room. No employee visible, the hostess stand deserted. The only employee I could see in the entire restaurant was the bartender!\nAfter waiting for about 5, a girl came up, and asked how many in our party. I responded \"two of us, but is there a wait??\" She responds, \"yes at least 10-15 minutes\".\nAt this point I look around the restaurant, way more empty tables then full. Like David K stated, I understand the shifts and seating requirements in a restaurant, but customer service and perception is always #1. \n\nNeedless to say, I walked out before we were seated, fearing what could come of this experience. From the other reviews it seems I didn't miss anything. Seems it all boils down to poor management. It is not the employees fault if the manager has no clue how to run a business. I have been meaning to eat here for a while, based on friends and other Yelpers. Boy am I glad I finally did. \n\nTook an out of town friend here for lunch Saturday. Sat outside as it was a beautiful day. Early on in the lunch of waiter, \"Derrick\", accidentally knocked a glass of water on my friends lap. Us being pretty laid back, no big deal. Well Derrick took it very seriously apologizing multiple times, gave us a free goat cheese app, which was as good as it was unexpected. And then proceeded to tell us a story about how he dumped a glass of wine on a guys head early on in his waiting experience. He turned a potential disaster lunch, into one of the best I have had.\n\nNow onto the food, all around incredible!! Goat cheese app, fantastic. I got braised beef veg, soup, it was excellent. Had the pasta of the day which was grouper and salmon over spaghetti in a diablo sauce. Also very good. \"Mamas pasta\" with pesto went over very well with my friend. \n\nI can't wait to get back and try the \"New Haven\" style pizza, as I grew up in New Haven, and am VERY picky about my pizza!!", "user_id": "27aGnUabXY23OH5oilHe7g", "business_id": "qYuSoVBS_1i_btLzFefDeg"}
{"text": "Showmars on 3rd delivers solid food, not great but they do a pretty decent job on meat and 2 veggies and the fish or chicken pita's are definitely worth a try......and on your 'cheat' days enjoy a milkshake if you dare:-) Soho is not on my list of places to go for lunch uptown, but occasionally group lunches leave you no choice, so I end up having to come here once or twice a year and my view of them still has not changed........average. Oh Simmons, I remember better days when you were the place for soul food in this town.....I wish I could turn back the hands of time to better  food from you.  I returned after all this time hoping you were back to your old self but what I found was not so good beef tips over rice, ok mac and cheese and collards.  Perhaps this was an off day since the cook wasn't feeling well....I dunno but the banana pudding is exactly how I remember......fresh and yummy. Gotta love Salsarita's, one of my favorite lunch spots.  Fresh food, great salsa, great prices!  My only suggestion would be to add grilled fish taco's to the menu. Mert's has been around for some time now and they still remain the same in that it's all in what you order which will determine whether you're going to like them or not.  Some things are really good like the cornbread, soul rolls, and salmon cakes but some things are just ok like the mac n cheese, greens, and chicken.  The service is always pleasant and their dedicated patrons will keep them among the soul food favorites in Charlotte. Ok, so I was in a pasta type of mood and decided to try Luce to see if all the hype was legit..........and I'll just say that Luce has been added to my Italiano list:-)  I had the express lunch which includes bread, soup or salad, an entree and a drink for $13 guaranteed in 30 minutes or less.  The soup of the day was lobster bisque, which was super yummy with the bread and my entree was the buttera(tubular pasta, italian sausage, sweet peas and tomato-cream sauce).....double yummy!  Hand clap for Luce, I may just have to check out their sister restaurants too! Two words....Chicken Milano!  I'm not a big fan of Quiznos they're just too expensive for a toasted sub, but I have no problems opening the wallet for this toasty treat!   A great sub with chicken, sun dried tomato and basil pesto, plus the trimmings are definitely something to smile about......give it a try, I'm sure you'll agree:-) Let me start off by saying I love GOOD Italian food, thus the reason it's been several years since my last visit here. I was asked to give them another try by 2 fellow foodies, mainly because they made the signature bread pudding sound so good and there was a $20 certificate for $5 on juice in the city.....that is the only reason I returned after all this time. I'm not sure how this place has been here as long as they have, I mean let's be honest.....the food is sub par. Again, I am a lover of Italian food and if your signature rigatoni with meat sauce can't even compete with stouffer's.....that's a problem. I mean the noodles were hard and chewy, the sauce was salty and the bread was tasteless....this is a basic Italian dish which I would think could never be screwed up........geez! The penne alla vodka was also full of salt with hard and chewy noodles......glad I only paid $5 bucks! The bread pudding, which is not on the menu, gave me something to smile about after a bad meal.......It was covered in caramel sauce I think and served with ice cream.......very good...........to bad they're not a dessert bar.", "user_id": "jp5lBxgdCpDRhSeEuRK_kA", "business_id": "ASwN3Ih0Eh1oH0npLbzVjA"}
{"text": "Oh, so tacky and cliche. That's what makes Buca di Beppo so great. From the Christmas-light-wrapped statues outside to photos of nuns running through the ocean inside, everything gaudy and over-the-top about Italian-American culture is embodied in the restaurant.\n\nThe experience starts with the escort to your table, which takes a detour through the kitchen (where there is also a booth table. In the kitchen.) and around by the Pope Room used for large parties (with a creepy wax bust on a rotating dais in the middle of the table).\n\nFood is served family style. A \"small\" plate will feed 2 to 3 people. Everything is very tasty - I personally love the baked pasta dishes, the garlic bread, and their salads can be a meal by themselves, too. Not a place you want to come unless you are feeling hungry.\n\nMy only complaint is that their only Charlotte location is in Pineville and rather tough to get to for me. But when I'm in the area, a great place to stop! What a truly wonderful restaurant all the way around. It's rare I feel like I've been \"wowed\" when I go out, but The Captial Grille had that effect and they did so in a way that seemed effortless and second-nature.\n\nWe were lured in after the recent Elite event (and actually made our dinner reservations within an hour of the event). The ambiance is exquisite without being extravagant, with many formal-looking portraits, iron, and a wealth of masculine darkly-stained wood.\n\nThe kitchen was spot-on during our visit - not a single thing came to the table that wasn't outstanding. We both started with the bacon clam chowder - smokey and rich. My entree was the filet Mignon, a timeless classic (and a personal favorite). I ordered mine medium rare: my first experience in Charlotte where my steak was brought to me a true medium rare. It's a tender cut that the chefs worked wonders with. A had the dry-aged Kona crusted sirloin - his was equally amazing with explosive flavors. Dessert brought chocolate espresso flour-less cake. Exceptionally rich and decadent - the perfect end to the meal.\n\nAs an experienced oenophile, I am in heaven at The Capital Grille. The wine selection has no comparison in the area - many, many phenomenal producers represented from around the globe, a survey of the best-of-the-best in wine. We mentioned we had attended for the summer Generous Pour event earlier and paid for it again tonight. This time, though, the server turned it into a guessing game: we'd order one, he'd bring two, seeing if we could identify the mystery wine from the list he recommended with our food. \n\nSpeaking of the service, TCG is in a league of their own in the area. The staff, who had or reservation, greeted us by name at the door and at our table. The manager recognized us from the week before and made it a point to stop by and welcome us and to wish us well at the end of the evening. Down to the very smallest detail of folding your napkin if you need to leave the table during your meal, this team embodies every stellar trait of the service industry.\n\nWhile The Captial Grille is not in the budget for a regular meal (yet), they are now my first choice for a venue to celebrate and to show off everything Charlotte has to offer. Most of the Italians I have known have mothers and grandmothers that are very likely to tell you, \"You're so skinny! You need to eat!  Sit down and let me cook you something.\"  That kind of woman, who can cook me something anytime she wants, must be behind Mama Ricotta's.\n\nIt's very warm and inviting inside, with bright reds and oranges and fun paintings, while still being dim and intimate.  The great wood stove and friendly staff that greets you certainly sets the stage for the evening.  We started with the goat cheese appetizer which was creamy and decadent, though didn't scream \"goat cheese\" to me.  It was very good, nonetheless.  For my main entree, I got one of the great meat sauce pasta dishes which is everything you expect great Italian food to be.  I was also impressed with the wine list (which comes to you as more of a book than a list) and the many small-production Italian wines that it contains.\n\nThough a little tough to find, given it's strip mall locale, Mama Ricotta's is a must-try!", "user_id": "4bIXGkoeMczOe6goszBJkQ", "business_id": "SVKC_-gIQFkHElZ6bFsE6g"}
{"text": "I have mixed feelings about Bruegger's but I still keep coming back here, quite regularly in fact.\n\nFavorite thing about Bruegger's? The Jalepeno Cheese speciaty bagel. Yummy, chewy, cheesey, and spicy... all at once! Sometimes I get it with just cream cheese, sometimes as a breakfast bagel with egg. But usually I get it with hummus, veggie cream cheese, and lotsa fresh veggies.\n\nWorst thing about Bruegger's? I think it's over priced. The hummus sandwich mentioned above it around $5. It just seems like a lot for what It is. They actually used to have this sandwich as a menu item back in the day, but now I have to itemize it and I guess that's what jacks up the price.\n\nI know it's a fast food of sorts, but most of the employees here are young airheads who look at me like I'm crazy when I ask for hummus (because maybe no one else orders it?) Give me a big smile, courtesey and a little enthusiasm when you're taking my hard earned money... please?\n\nOh, and the decor/cleanliness could use a little UMPH. Came here for the first time on 1/20/2012 with friends. Atmosphere isn't overly fancy like some places downtown, but definitely way nicer than your average take out Chinese.\n\nOrdered sesame tofu since it's my old faithful at any Chinese restaurant... and boy was I impressed!  Definitely the best sesame tofu I've had since \"House\" on Independence closed down. Tofu was a perfect amount of chewy and crispy and not overly sauced. \n\nSteamed white rice was delish and spring rolls were definitely superior than any other I've had, but I couldn't put my finger on exactly why.\n\nVegetarian friendly.\n\nThe only down to this restaurant, like any business in downtown Charlotte, is that you have to park in a deck or meter on the street (if you can find one). I know for sure that Hearst Tower parking tickets can be validated by Soho so that parking is free! I have some mixed feelings about Mama Ricotta's, but ultimately I leave the restaurant pretty happy and satisfied every time.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that they took the Butternut Squash Ravioli off the menu... WHY??!?! I truly loved this dish!!  The raviolis themselves were plump and yummy, the squash was rich and creamy, and balanced out with walnuts. Who knows why, no one ever wants to give me a straight answer. Apparently a lot of people still request the dish, so occasionally they will stock the ingredients just to randomly prepare it... but still, I would eat here all the time if they kept this!\n\nInstead I've ordered the Penna Alla Vodka (minus the pancetta) and the Ravioli Alla Fiorentina. These are both pretty good and would definitely recommend them, but they're just not the same!!!\n\nI HIGHLY RECOMMEND The Warm Goat Cheese and Marscapone Dip! This stuff is off the chain amazing! My mouth is watering just thinking about it! \n\nI like the dark, cozy feel of the restaurant with drum shade lighting. Thumbs up to the high ratio of booth seating. Worst thing about the decor here are the ridiculous pasta paintings. Good God, the color schemes on these things are hideous. Someone needs to remove those, ASAP.\n\nService here has been mixed, 85% of the time waiters have been quick, polite, and right on. But I have had an occasional dud.\n\nThe prices here are a little high, expect to spend over $12 a person minimum. The good news is they have coupons in the Charlotte Citipass book! Buy One, Get One baby! \n\nExpect a wait on the weekends (10-20 minutes at least).

{"text": "The in-laws were in town this past weekend, so we decided to show them the newly opened Romare Bearden Park. The park was a lot of fun and after checking it out we decided to stroll over to French Quarter for lunch. \n\nI had high hopes for French Quarter, given my love of Uptown restaurants and my affinity for Cajun-inspired food, but I have to say both the food and the customer service was a major letdown.\n\nOur server was not very attentive, forgot what we ordered, brought our food out without silverware and took several minutes to provide us with silverware so that we could actually eat, and failed to refill our drinks. The restaurant was also FREEZING... last Saturday was literally the nicest day of the year and they had the air on what had to be 65, totally unnecessary! \n\nOnce we were finally able to eat our food, it was a) cold from us not getting silverware for a few minutes and the restaurant being crazy cold & b) not that great. The gumbo tasted like it came from a can and the mashed potatoes tasted like they were instant.\n\nIf the food and service wasn't enough to leave a bad impression, the restrooms were disgusting and there was no toilet paper. I will definitely not be returning to French Quarter... which is a shame because they're in a primo location! Let me start out by saying: I love Mama Ricotta's food. I've had several great experiences both in the restaurant and with their catering. That being said, last night's performance -aside from the scrumptious food- was not acceptable.\n\nI went with a group of ~15 people to Mama Ricotta's for a Christmas function. I was one of the people that voted to have the event at the restaurant because I've had such great experiences in the past. I know a larger party requires patience on both ends and that mistakes are inevitable, but we had quite a few... our drink orders were mixed up repeatedly. One person ordered a salad with romaine lettuce and it came out with iceburg. The servers kept placing the wrong meals with the wrong individuals, which I know is hard not to do with a big group -but it added to our frustration. We did all get our food, but none of the dishes came out at the same time, so several people's food was cold by the time the final entree came out. \n\nThe real fun started with the checks. Given the issues we had getting the right entree/drink to the right person, we knew the bills were going to be a nightmare -and they were. It took nearly 45 minutes to get our bills straightened out. By the time I actually received my bill (which was about 10 minutes after everyone else had paid and was leaving the restaurant) it was incorrect. I notified the server that my glass of Pinot Grigio was not on the ticket, he asked if that was a red wine. I know you only have to be 18 to serve alcohol, but it's important for servers to know which wines are white and which are red for customer service purposes. The server tried again with the ticket, which I had to go to the hostess stand to get, and it still did not have a glass of wine on it. Because I needed to leave I spoke to the manager, who was very nice and told me just to pay for my entree... but he kind of made me feel like I was making a stink to get my wine comped -which was not the case.\n\nWill I try Mama Ricotta's again? Yes, but never again will I go back with a large group & I'll make sure not to order wine next time.", "user_id": "20ugCO0X45aww6IuP66tRA", "business_id": "376PDtBpGi74Os08TvCkhg"}
{"text": "from ny originally, have been looking for a good pizza place for the past couple months.  finally found it :) the price is really good as well. I went here for a work lunch the other day and everything was excellent. We ordered the appetizer tower that came with mussels, crab cakes and fried green tomatoes. It was all delicious. The mussels were my favorite part. \n\nI ordered the Mediterranean veggie wrap with a side of sweet potatoes. It was perfect :). The location is nice too. The pizzas my husband and I ordered were mediocre.  They were pretty greasy and I had the impression they had been sitting around for a while and just heated up before they were brought out to us.  I think this place is overpriced for the quality of food they serve.  The waitstaff was attentive.  I don't think we'll return. This place is terrible. We chose to go out to eat here as we had only heard great things about Capital Grille. We will never return to this establishment for a meal again. \n\nOur waiter was very nice and the decor of the restaurant is beautiful as well. For starters I got the mozzarella basil tomato salad. It was pretty good so no complaints there. I chose the special of the night for my entree which was three small steaks prepared in three signature ways. I loved two of them the balsamic one was pretty bad but not inedible. Our water glasses were left empty several times which I thought was weird considering how much a meal like this costs. My husband ordered the porterhouse and he asked for it to be medium. Well it was bordering on the side of well-done and I tasted his and didn't like it at all. He thought it was very dry and it wasn't hot it seemed as though it had been sitting around before they brought it out to us. Honestly the steaks he grills from Teeter have more flavor than this dish. This was obviously very disappointing but we just thought ok not worth the money but we would possibly return for the specialty dishes at a future date. \n\nThe main reason I am giving a one star review is because I woke up in the middle of the night with awful stomach pains and have been sick for the past 10 hours. My husband was nauseas but not as sick as me.  We didn't sleep practically at all last night and because of this i would never ever return here. I would recommend grilling steaks on your own grill and not wasting a ton of money to get an underwhelming sickening experience. The food was literally inedible. We had calimari as our app & it was very yummy. We were excited about our entrees based on this course. My husband ordered the shrimp gnocchi dish. It tasted like orange peels-even the shrimp. There was a pesto sauce & orange rinds in the dish, which we thought was an interesting combo. I never tasted such an overwhelming orange dish in my life. Nothing had any other taste except orange zest. I had the duck, which was okay. Nothing to write home about. The duck was really rough & fatty. Came with a side of asparagus & rice. The veggies & rice were okay. I preferred them over the duck. For dessert, we ordered the cheesecake to split. We didn't even finish it. Would definitely NEVER go back I went here last night for the first time and I am a huge fan.  The bread and oil they bring out is delicious.  I got the lasagna for my dinner and it was SO SO good.  It was a normal sized portion which is nice - usually restaurants bring out crazy big dishes of lasagna and it's gross.  This might be my favorite lasagna I had at a restaurant - the sauce, cheeses and everything was perfect.  They have a really good menu - lots of options and lots of price ranges which is nice, too.\n\nThe service was excellent and there is a lot of seating which is good since they probably get super busy on weekends.", "user_id": "w1P9cvIVTxcLZvU5tXIhRw", "business_id": "sJtGRBWYUj013nkFA4Hrdg"}
{"text": "Worst service I have ever had. The waitress the first time I went was a little short, not personable. The second time about 2-3 months later was just awful. So slow, rude, forgetful and uncaring. I was there on a weeknight, for over 2 hours.  I just don't even know what to say. It made my whole experience disappointing.  I won't go back to this location. The food here is decent, prices not so much. As I understand, it is family style. But what if not everyone wants the same thing? Then pay a ridiculous amount for a single serving? The drinks and salads are also soooo pricey. Nothing special. I don't like chains a lot, but some I tolerate.  OG is one of them, because I grew up with it.   This is my favorite location, but food and service is always just hit or miss.  I think that is to be expected with a chain.  Sometimes I have a good experience and sometimes not so much.  I think that it is a little overpriced, and seems that the pricing is always going up while the quality of food is always going down.  Sometimes I think that it was better several years ago.  The breadsticks seem to never change, always good-and I always eat too much of them!! Not as good as I expected. We were instantly seated and ordered our food. It took a long time to get the food and the wrong things came out. We waited forever for the correct items. And then waited forever again for the server to return...then forever once more to pay/get cards back.  The food was average. Nothing special. I came here for lunch. I had a bagel egg salad sandwich. It was fast, friendly service. There was no wait. Prices are ok. The parking is pretty plentiful, I usually don't have any trouble finding a spot. My sandwich was pretty good, not out of this world..but acceptable. I will probably be back. A lot of talking among staff causing them to be very slow with my order at lunchtime.  This is really frustrating, especially at this time of day. The garden veggie soup is watery, not recommended. I was displeased with my last visit at this location due to some customer service issues.  I received a message from the management asking me to come back and try again with lunch on them.  I went in at lunchtime, around noon, same as before.  There was a line already formed at the counter.  The staff was working hard to ensure everyone had a quick visit.  The line went smoothly and I ordered the new sandwich: The Parisian, which is ham, brie, and green apples.  It was delicious!  I skipped the soup this time because I didn't like it,  and opted for the whole sandwich.  The sweet tea was tasty and perfectly sweet.  There was no talking amongst employees, just everyone working hard to serve the customers.  I met Andre, the manager upon checking out and reminded him about his email.  He was very pleasant and welcoming.  I would like to say that it means a lot for management to reach out to customers who are unhappy, even with the slightest of issue.  I think it shows how much they care and really just means a lot to the whole of the business and what they think of their customers.  Connecting this way with people is a reason I will be back.  I know if I ever have a problem, this place will care enough to help me. A little overpriced.  The food was overall pretty good. I know a few other Italian restaurants that I would pick first just because of price.  I wasn't disappointed with the food, just not extraordinary.  Service was good.", "user_id": "H8eeWraDOMtorUlQUkXqpw", "business_id": "BO0zz8gort7o-6KuecIv3Q"}
{"text": "We drove 25 minutes for this place! The staff was super friendly and the food was fantastic! \n\nMy boyfriend and I had date night here. The pasta was perfect and the starter salad I got was pretty big! My boyfriend opted for the family size serving which left him with enough to take home for another meal. And the wine selection is phenomenal I asked my waitress for a non oaky Chardonnay and I got the most delicious buttery wine I've ever had! Needless to say highly recommended, especially for date night! We went here again tonight for my boyfriend parents anniversary and I can't tell you how awesome it was. Again I got the buttery Chardonnay and it was fantastic. I ended up ordering the salmon dish based on seeing it walk by my table. It looked amazing! However when I got my plate it was tiny and burnt well I asked the waiter about it and right away he took it back and they prepared a brand new on for me. It was perfect and definitely worth the 23$ I spent on the dish. \n\nI would higher recommend this place, they take care of you and really want you to enjoy your meal and make sure the money you spend it worth it. Five out of five for me. The boyfriend and boyfriends parents loved it too! I'm disappointed. I've been here three times now and the first two times were amazing. I'm not kidding, they took care of us, the waiter was friendly and they even changed out my salmon when it wasn't up to their standards,again amazing. BUT this third time was not a shining star like I'd hoped it would be. \n\nI brought my cousins from out of town they love Italian food! I had such nice service the two previous times I just knew they'd love it here because of the good food and the good service. \n\nOur server was very neglectful. It took her a very long time to come take our drink order. Which we weren't ready for because they didn't give us a cocktail list. So we order appetizers, calamari and the bruschetta, and she got the cocktail menus, brought them to us, and left again. Our appetizers came and her second return took much too long again. So we ordered drinks and She carded me, my boyfriend and my cousin which is fine,I'm 26, he's 23, and he's 22, so we're all used to that and I don't fault her for it. She took our drink orders, and food orders and walked away without taking our menus from us or saying another thing. Now it was four of us sitting at our small table with two appetizers, a bread bowl and bread plates and all the extras you can think of on the table. There was no where for us to put anything let alone menus we no longer needed. My boyfriend asked the hostess who was walking by to take the menus and mentioned that our waitress wasn't really caring for us. \n\nNext thing I know the manager came over and apologized for the lack of caring and for her not taking the menus which seemed super nice. It reminded me of the other times we were here when they took such good care of us.  But that wasn't really why he was at our table that was just glanced over. He really just wanted to see our IDs too. I'm a reasonable person and I understand needing to be carded but by TWO different people at a very nice sit down restaurant just seems over kill to me. Especially when my already non caring waitress walked away acting like she's going to put our orders in. At least warning us that you just want you manager to check our IDs would have made it feel less degrading. Honestly this whole thing made me feel pretty down on this place. It's really disappointing and severely changes my opinion of this place which sucks because we really loved it before this. \n\nThe food was good and thats the only reason it's four stars and not three, but I just don't need to pay that amount of money to feel degraded and unhappy after I have a meal somewhere.", "user_id": "0wqedmbkiFZuItR_5w4CJw", "business_id": "MQnNtW1lHS-eid3QNUoUIw"}
{"text": "I had a hankering for an egg roll one day. Sometimes these things happen. If you don't judge me, I won't judge you. I poked around on my Yelp App until I found a decent place near to where I was lurking that day. Soho Bistro has a rather fancy website that I found I couldn't resist!\n\nI ordered a few things, because you can't just get egg rolls. What about when you are also craving crab rangoon? And, hey, look they've got honey walnut prawns on the menu. Seaweed salad? That sounds healthful, and I tend to like seaweed. Let's do it!\n\n- Egg rolls - straightforward. did the job.\n- Crab rangoon - really really mushy and had.. carrot in there? shredded carrot? I can't say I liked it.\n- Honey walnut prawns - No. They were fried and came in a thick brown sauce with vegetables. This is not what it's supposed to look like. These were definitely NOT the droids I was looking for.\n- Seaweed salad - Awesome, if a bit plain. I could have done without the pointless bed of shredded lettuce on the bottom. But the seaweed itself was awesome.\n- Sauce - The sweet and sour sauce that generally comes with the fried goodies was really weird here. It was really dark red and syrupy, and did not taste very pleasant. I can't recommend it.\n\nHuge bonus points for \n1. having a great website \n2. having a menu on the website. \n3. being able to order online. \n4. having a REALLY awesome staff person answer the phone, answer questions, and even brought my food to the curb before I even slowed to a stop.\n\nThe place is definitely different, but I'm willing to give some of the other stuff a try. Being Chinese, I'm really picky about my Chinese food, and I've already rejected most of the other joints in the area. The reviews seemed to be hit-or-miss, but I decided to take a leap and try it out. I hadn't tried any Indian restaurants in the Charlotte area, so I went ahead and ordered several take out dishes to try. It might be important to note I'd had a huge curry craving for months. Maharani, while it definitely hit the spot, was lacking in a few areas.\n\nI called in the order and then went to pick it up. It was very straightforward and simple. They had the food ready exactly when they said they would. The servers and cashier were very friendly and courteous.\n\nI tried the plain naan, chicken tikka masala, lamb vindaloo, and mutter paneer. I even found some papadum and mint sauce wrapped up in my bag, which was nice. For some reason, having the papadum feels nice and familiar. The naan was alright, but not as fluffy as I had hoped. It was crispier in a lot of places, and I think it just needs to be a bit thicker. The chicken in the tikka masal was very good and very moist (yes, I know a lot of people hate that word. It's a good word to use in this case!). The vindaloo was decent, except that the chunks of meat and potato were enormous. I was taught to eat Indian food by a Sri Lankan, which means I eat with my hands. I'm not used to having to pick up a giant wedge of potato and figuring out how to eat it cleanly. The mutter paneer was also alright, but the paneer was kind of tough and not soft like I'm used to. \n\nLike I said, it hit the spot, but I wouldn't order the vindaloo again, and I'm iffy on the paneer. Maybe it needs to be more fresh? I don't know how paneer works. The biggest issue was the salt level in the food. There was WAY. TOO. MUCH. SALT. If you are one of those people who loves to add salt, then this is all for you. I will give it another try, but only if they might agree to ease up on the salt... a lot.", "user_id": "dsEe-vY8UEYVQ1LpZCYT4w", "business_id": "rT-iPtIXMKj3dTcl87lbOw"}
{"text": "WOW. Considering I'm a vegetarian and this is a steakhouse, it was strange that I had lunch at Morton's yesterday. The only reason I went was b/c they were hosting a Women's Luncheon, and I wanted to attend that, but I didn't think they would have anything that I could actually eat or would like. It feels even stranger to say that they did and it was good! \n\nMorton's exceeded my expectations by quite a lot. \n\nFirst of all, Krista, their Sales & Mktng Manager, was incredibly accommodating. I emailed her ahead of time to see if they had a meatless option, and she was great about writing back quickly and gave me the alternative course, which was fully vegetarian, and even asked for confirmation if it would work. I said yes, and it did. \n\nThe fist plate they served was a delicious deviled egg salad (they made sure I wasn't vegan before bringing this out). It was HUGE and very good. The serving size was actually enough to split between four people! The deviled eggs were diced into mini cubes and really nicely evenly spread throughout the salad. I loved the dressing too, though I'm not sure exactly what it was. I think it was ranch. \n\nThe main course was another gigantic plate. It was filled with broccoli, sauteed spinach, mushrooms, and grilled tomatoes. To look at, it was not that special, but the sauce that was added to all the vegetables was mouthwatering and made a plate of vegetables taste amazing. I also was served a ginormous bowl of mashed potatoes (also yummilious!). \n\nBy the time dessert was ready, I was absolutely stuffed. I asked for my cheesecake to go and shared it with my parents when we had dinner. The portion was so large and it was soo rich that even though we split it three ways, it was still filling! \n\nThe staff was very professional and the place was nice. I'm surprised to say I wouldn't mind going back. Yet ANOTHER place I LOVE in Charlotte and wish existed in Columbia! If I lived in Charlotte, there is no doubt I would be a regular here! \n\nFor anyone who's traveled abroad and hit those beachy bar restaurants where time stops and no one is in a rush, everyone is up to talk, and you just feel like you're on vacation. Well that's Cuisine Malaya in a nutshell. The entire staff, from bartender to manager to server, is sooo nice and sooo laid back. The service was comparable to that of what I've received in some of the best travel spots. Two of us in our party got there early so we waited at the bar, had wine, and hung out with the staff. Killing close to an hour never went by so fast. Seriously we had so much fun with the Cuisine Malaya folks that it was almost a bit of a disappointment when the rest of our group showed up and we had to move to our table! \n\nThe food is just as amazing as the service (thank you Carrie!). For our party of six, we had several appetizers, wine, many entrees, and dessert. I won't list every single thing we ordered but I will say EVERYTHING was delicious. The highlights for me were the roti telur appetizer. If you like Indian food, this will make you smile. It's basically an Indian pancake (savory, not sweet!) that comes with a cup of curry sauce to dip it in. The flavor was not too strong and the amount of oil they used was just right, not overly greasy/fattening. The other MAJOR hit for me was the tofu lemongrass entr\u00e9e. It has such a punch to it, the second you put a spoon of it in your mouth, you will feel a spark. Absolutely DE-licious! For spice lovers out there, Cuisine Malaya is a haven. Our table included one Indian (me), four Liberians, and one white woman (who says she has a black woman inside of her and has the spice tolerance of an Indian!). We all LOVE spicy food and they had no problem catering to our pallets. We got so many chili paste refills, I lost track! The other thing I want to point out is that they have some of THE best wine I've ever had. We had two bottles of their Takar Plum Wine, which is sweet, rich and made in Japan. I think only one person in our group was reserved on this, everyone else had a minimum of two glasses. I also had their Chateau St. Michelle Reisling and it was dangerously good. I mean, you will taste no trace of alcohol, just sugary sweetness. At times I felt like I was drinking a great non-alcoholic drink and took big gulps. You WILL get a buzz so drink with caution! And lastly, dessert! Aaaaah, the cherry on the top to this magical dining out experience! We got their pancakes with peanut ice cream and it was to die for. I may be butchering what it's called but it's the only dessert choice that has peanut butter flavor in it and it will create a dance party in your mouth. Soooooooo good! \n\nMy suggestion if you plan to go here is to order food family style, sample as much as you can (you will be satisfied!) and start with less and build up. We didn't realize how HUGE their portion sizes are and got way more than what we could eat, we all ended up taking carry out boxes with us. One entr\u00e9e can easily feed two. If you're not that hungry, then it could even stretch and fill up three. And if you do drink, plan ahead and figure out a DD. This place has a SUPERB wine selection, you can really lose yourself and before you know it, drown down 3-4 drinks very quickly. \n\nFinally, my parting words on what's turning out to be a super long review, is: Eat, drink, and be Merry! Cuisine Malaya will afford you all three!", "user_id": "-NcGO7nzM6w2ClVslI4NDQ", "business_id": "Lt9o2RmacVY2L-IWLA8uTg"}
{"text": "I now understand why I always see people eating in their cars in this parking lot. I didn't make it very far without sneaking a bite, and in the future I'll know not to press my luck and just enjoy my food with the others parked out front.\n\nThere are definitely no frills here, I walked in the doors to a long counter with a woman standing behind it, a series of reach-in coolers behind her filled with assorted jamaican drinks amoung other things I didn't catch, and a fairly open kitchen with a stove, a steam table, a warmer, and some equipment around the corner I couldn't see. As noted in another review it was (refreshingly) very clean. The menu is posted on the window as you walk in, along the wall on the inside, and also on a chalk board inside. I don't know if the chalkboard changes at all, but it seemed to have the same items on it as the printed menus.\n\nI was a little torn by the options: red snapper, oxtail, curry, a stew, goat, jerk chicken... but I went with the jerk chicken. And then comes the decision on the sides... mac n cheese, cabbage, more rice n beans, greens.. I went with cabbage. A small plate is a whole to go container of rice & beans, chicken, and cabbage - so I have no idea what kind of food you get in a large plate. The desserts sounded fantastic, I almost got a rum cake but stopped myself. (That was the one moment I was happy I couldn't sit down and eat, because I knew if I had more time to debate with myself the rum cake would have been purchased.) My small plate and a ting came to around $11. Not bad. \n\nAfter I ordered, the box was assembled as I stood there, everything either sitting hot on the stove or warm in the steam table. I was a little surprised as she flashed the filled container to me in approval before she shut it, but looking back it was nice touch to be able to check my order right there instead of getting to my car (or home) and being disappointed. I got to my car and noticed a few others eating, took a few bites myself, and then continued home. (windows down, windows up made it too tempting to nosh at every stop light)\n\nThe jerk was really nice, very mild and sweet. I almost wished it had a little bit more heat to it, but very good. The cabbage was a little on the salty side but once you start mixing it in with the perfectly cooked rice and beans it all evens out. \n\nI definitely want to try a few other items on the menu, and if they are anywhere near the caliber of the jerk, I know I'll be very happy with them as well. For a while I never understood why people raved about Cuisine Malaya. My sushi was always okay, the hibachi was standard, my service was mediocre on most days, and I just couldn't get over a 2.5/3 star experience. Then one day I decided I didn't need sushi, I was going to try a lunch special... and then angels started to sing.\n\nLittle did I know it was just the beginning of an enlightening journey into the rest of the menu (which they now have a supplement to with wine pairings, more veg options, and better descriptions). The mango chicken lunch special was awesome - but my sa cha chicken dinner on a return visit was even better, and the bite of the triple charm special definitely put up there on my \"to order next\" list. On our last trip we started with the malay lobak and it's a tasty table pleaser with its combo pork, tofu, and shrimp options. I have a tendency to almost always order the ginger house salad, forgetting that the dressing has a slight bitterness to it that isn't my favorite... it's completely edible, though.\n\nThe service is still wonky. If my server doesn't forget an item they forget about our table, and on the last trip we had a new girl who couldn't answer very many of our questions about the menu.  But, with my improved view of their food, I'll take a few missteps in the service part, and overall they've been efficient when I've needed to get in and out during a lunch hour. I might go back to the sushi at some point, but for now I think there are too many other delish things to order.", "user_id": "GLJazgesK2b_mRYQaEc8rA", "business_id": "CDH2dyRcJUDPM1xj4AD0lQ"}
{"text": "The following things make Ri Ra amazing, no arguments. Period. End of discussion.\n\n1. McSorley's Dark, not only on draft but served in half pints as God intended.\n\n2. Colman's mustard available on request. She brought malt vinegar for my fries, sorry \"chips\", without me having to ask. Together they are the end all, be all of chip eating.\n\n3. Super tasty and generous food. I loved the beer battered fish and chips and the pork chop with broccolini and potato cake looked (and I'm told was) great.\n\n4. Cragganmore single malt. Yes, it is pricey. A single will run you $12 but it is my favorite scotch, so I say it gets a number.\n\n5. Friendly and jovial staff. We made an open table reservation on a Friday night and though they called to say they couldn't necessarily honor the exact time, when we showed up they had our table waiting despite walk in customers waiting to be seated.\n\n6. Did I say McSorely's and Colman's w/malt vinegar? Because if I did why are we still talking?\n\nRi Ra is a classy version of the Irish pub I love to feel at home in. Go check it out. It might just save your impression of Uptown. Mama Ricotta's sets out to be good old fashioned Italian home cooking, an admirable and delicious goal no doubt.  The problem is that they don't really set them selves apart from what your average Italian girl (or guy) ::raises hand:: can actually make in their home.\n\nThe pasta special, a tilapia, shrimp and scallop spaghetti dish with a slightly spicy sauce, was the exception to this rule. It had a delicious sea flavor and I regret not having ordered it as my dinner. My penne vodka sounded enticing, promising pepper vodka and including pancetta, but the sauce ended up being unsensational.  Looking at the rest of the menu, I saw a lot of familiar characters: lasagna, angel hair with red sauce, and chicken romano to name a few, but few options that jumped out and screamed that I needed to try it.\n\nI love Italian food at least as much as the next girl but if I am going to go out for it I want to be impressed and while Mama Ricotta's provided a good meal it didn't shine. I had high hopes for Cuisine Malaya since it has a great rating and had been recommended by 2 separate friends but my experience was not beyond adequate. We stopped in about an hour before close on a Saturday night and the place was surprisingly empty. True it's a large space, but still.\n\nWe started off with soup and both my Tom Yum and the BF's Hot and Sour were great. Unlike some other Tom Yums you certainly had no trouble finding the chicken and veggies. I ordered the Beef Randang extra spicy (beyond what the little pepper beside it on the menu was already supposed to indicate). What I got was certainly beef. I can't really speak to its randang-ness since I am no expert. I felt like it could have used a vegetable or 10 to break up the beef chunks covered in thick sauce. None were mentioned but they weren't mentioned in the BF's Chicken Basil either and it was teeming with them. What my dish most assuredly was not was spicy. At all.\n\nOur waiter, who was very pleasant, brought me additional ground chili but even they had no zip in them. No veggies and no spice made the meal sort of a downer for me. I'm sure they make other dishes I would like, but there are too many other good Asian fusion places in CLT for me to pencil in a return visit to Cuisine Malaya.", "user_id": "C3j3opcesIOdPoy7qzGgVQ", "business_id": "WuCcv_Dyd_1B_1-4jwK7sQ"}
{"text": "My son and I dined here recently.  He's a steak fan and I was looking for something he would eat!  My son ordered a Rib eye (standard) and I ordered the Parmesan Encrusted Chicken w/ a sweet potato and veggies.\nOur meal was prepared well and it didn't take very long.  My son's steak was cooked properly and since he \"woofed\" it down, I suppose it was pretty good!\nMy Parmesan chicken was excellent.  There were two pieces on the plate so I was quite satisfied with the serving size.  The sweet potato was average in size and properly cooked (baked); not burnt.  I always look for the fresh veggie sides these days and Longhorn didn't disappoint.  Very tasty!\nWe were very pleased with the service!  Our waitress kept our beverages filled and was most attentive! I'm just reviewing the bar today.\nWe've been meeting a coworker here for the past few weeks.  Convenient to the workplace...\nI really like this bar!  The staff is very attentive and, if you wait, you don't wait long.  Good selection of beverages, although I could see a few more tap selections...  No big deal for me at all!\nThe appetizer list a great and we've sampled several!  The Pat's World Famous Popcorn Shrimp are terrific!!  And, the sliders are excellent!\nGood upscale environment too!  Just a great place to stop by on the way out the door or anytime! We come to the Charlotte Cafe periodically primarily because they have a good variety of veggies on the menu.  The food is, like I said above, a-ok.  You won't write home about it,  but we find it to be just fine. It's like diner food to me.  \n\nTonight, I had the pork chop, and I've had it before.  It was good, tender, and cooked properly.  I had the collard greens and they were just fine!  Not full of stems like some I've encountered.\n\nThis is an \"easy\" place to go.  Easy to go with kids; easy to take your elderly mom.  Just easy, and not pretentious at all.  I see that others have complained about the service, but that's not what we have encountered here at all.  Maybe we hit the \"good\" days, but the wait staff has always been friendly, accommodating, and our service has consistently been good.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a unique, perhaps romantic, fine-dining experience... go across the parking lot.  But if you want a good meal, at a fair price, with several options to choose from, and in a relaxed  atmosphere - try the Charlotte Cafe. I dined here as part of a group recently.  Overall, we had an excellent experience.  First, with arrangements having been made beforehand (as you should with a group), they were most accommodating! The service simply couldn't have been any better for our group!  Ian, the Manager, personally made sure that everything was taken care of for us.\nThose in our group tried quite a variety of things from the menus.  So first, about the menu... they are very extensive and include dishes from several areas that geographically surround Malaysia.  They have everything from Japanese Sushi, to Indian curries, to multiple Chinese favorites.  They even have some Malaysian specialties on the menu too!  ; )  Some of the dishes that seemed to stand out for our group included the Malaysian Sea Bass and another Malaysian dish made with Stingray (or Skate).  I had the Curry Duck and thought it was quite good! I think that everyone in our group enjoyed the dishes they ordered, and that (for me) is quite a statement!\nThe location is great for dining before or after downtown activities or sporting events and there is adequate parking on both sides of the building.\nI don't have much to recommend for improvement, except that it may be time to organize the menus a bit.  There is more than one version and they differ.

{"text": "Wow. Using the overused term \"hidden gem\" really doesn't do Alexander Michael's proper justice. This place is so tucked within Fourth Ward, you most likely wouldn't notice it even if you were to traipse the entire neighborhood. Which, in my opinion, really makes this place shine. There's no grandiose entry way or signage laid out in lights. Just an old house on the corner of 9th with low lighting and a cozy interior. \n\nHINT: If you've never been here, I'd recommend cutting all the way over to Graham St and then turning onto 9th. You can't turn down 9th from Tryon, as 9th is split into two sections and you won't be able to drive direct. Also, parking is sparse. Find a place around the neighborhood and walk a few blocks. There is plenty of residential 2hr parking on the streets. \n\nSat at the bar and loved every creek and crack of the old floors and pillars. It's kind of tight quarters, but it gives it a cool pub feel. The taps coming directly out of the old cabinet style system is just gorgeous. Tons of local brews and some other fine beer choices were available. Didn't indulge as it was a 1pm lunch. I ended up order the london broil sandwich. Goodness gracious I'm glad I did, too. It was just right for lunch and paired with the pasta salad, you can't go wrong. \n\nService is so friendly here. You really get the feeling that these people have been at it for a long time and keep it old school. \n\nIf you haven't been or are on the fence, I highly recommend. Definitely one of the Uptown staples. Mert's is one of those go-to, Charlotte staple, consistently filling, always busy, and good-luck-finding-a-seat kind of spots you can't miss if you're a regular diner around town. Even if you're in town for an extended stay, Mert's should fall on your radar within in the first few days. \n\nWhere I'm not a huge soul/comfort food goer on the regular, the fried chicken, fried catfish, mac n' cheese and other sides have all sang beautifully upon my many visits. One thing that sticks out more frequently and consistently beckons my palate is the lemonade. Goodness gracious, it's that good. Sometimes, I think of stopping in just for a big glass to go. \n\nOne thing to keep in mind about Mert's is that it functions quite differently than other Uptown culinary hearths. This place is busy throughout the week and the weekends. Not uncommon for them to be on a wait well into a Sunday afternoon. Plan accordingly, should you find yourself visiting during any \"peak\" hour. \n\nService is ever-so friendly and I love the \"shoe art(?)\" in the men's bathroom. Kind of odd, but definitely worth a gander if you've never seen it. \n\nMert's, thank you. Just...for everything. I had been meaning to check out Cuisine Malaya for some time and was happy to finally check it out for lunch. Though I love Malaysian cuisine for it's mix of great curry dishes and noodles, I went with sushi here. Not exactly sure why, but I was rather satisfied with the selection. \n\nWe started with the roti telur which is one of our favorite Malaysian dishes. Theirs was a little more spicy than others we've had, and the curry was housed the typical potatoes swimming in a delicious curry sauce. The pancake was great and cut into larger pieces than usual. As always, eating this with chopsticks is the way to go!\n\nI ended up ordering a specialty sushi roll -- spicy tuna, avocado on top, a spicy mayo, and veggies. It was pretty standard and exactly what I expected. Nothing out of the ordinary. It was filling, but we all know the problem with sushi....Give yourself 30 minutes and you're hungry again! Blast! I should have ordered more to go! Service was a little sluggish and our food was brought out in oddly spaced waves. Not a deal-breaker, but it was a little inconvenient. \n\nI can't wait to go back and try one of the chef's specialties. I love the feel of this place as it is rather open with plenty of seating. \n\nA drawback is the odd placement and parking. There are like....4 entrances and only one of them is unlocked/functional as an entrance. Kind of weird, but who cares.

I would definitely recommend trying this place! Oh, Presto, my experience here was just - not - good.  First, my rating of 2/5 stars is based primarily on the food, not the service.  \n\nI dined with a friend on a week night.  The restaurant was pretty empty, no wait for a table.

So I had some money to spend, and Iwas able to taste quite a few dishes.  We started off with two appetizers: calamari and crab dip.  Calamari was very good; however, the sauce was, well, gross.  It was overly sweet and had an odd flavor.  We just ignored this and ate the calamari, as is.  The crab dip was another disappointment.  We were given plenty of chips, way more than we had dip for, which is never a great sign.  The cheese had a Velveeta consistency which I absolutely despise!  The cheese was loaded on the top with almost no crab flavor.  Toward the bottom there were whole chunks of crab...and you guessed it...now without any cheese!  \n\nI ordered the lasagna which came with a salad.  I ordered the Caesar salad.  Wow, this was just embarrassing (for them).  It was literally chopped Romaine with bottled dressing (I'd bet all my money - Ken's Steakhouse non-creamy kind).  I had about 4 bites and just put it aside.\n\nThe lasagna.  Well, remember that sauce with the calamari?  That's what is in the lasagna!  I actually had to send the dish back.  I was so disturbed by this sauce that I HAD to ask what was in it.  Well, tell me what you think - tomato sauce with cinnamon, and brown sugar.  \n\nI traded it in for a sandwich.  I just didn't know what to do.  I got a veggie sandwich with fries.  As a PS - bread was over saturated with oil but veggies tasted good.  Fries were under seasoned.  \n\nNot going back, but I think this place may be better as a lunch destination. I was here this past weekend for a charity event.  It was absolutely packed and the bartenders were working extra hard.  I mean literally breaking a sweat!    Despite it being very crowded, the restaurant stayed clean and cool!  \n\nWe ordered a Margarita pizza which was freaking delicious.  Every ingredient was fresh and tasty.  Even the mozzerella was fresh, not the shredded typical stuff.  I would definitely order this pizza again.  Although this time I did not order a salad, I have in the past ordered the Brixx Salad and it is also quite excellent.  \n\nThe price point is nice on the wallet.  Our pizza was $9.95 and can easily serve 2 people for dinner.  \n\nIn terms of atmosphere, it is more casual but in a classy, Italian way, not a sports bar type of way.  I will be going back for sure! First, I'm picky when it comes to pizza.  I was raised in NY and my parents would probably be mortified if they found out I gave a franchise pizza place 5 stars.  I've just got to be honest and this is my case:\n\n1. Drivers are always SO friendly.  A couple times they've offered to stand there with my pizza while I walked my dogs.  ( I usually bring the pups with my downstairs to pick up the food since I'm in an apt complex).\n2. With ONE exception, my pizza and break sticks get here in perfect condition.  Nothing is too cold, or dried out because it has been sitting out too long, etc.\n3. I order online.  It is so fast, and convenient for payment.  You simply just check if you are going to pay cash or credit card.  You can add a tip amount ahead of time of you pay by credit card.\n4.  Last but certainly not least, their pizza tastes wonderful!  I love adding different toppings or getting specialty pies.  If you have a sweet tooth try the cinnamon sticks with icing.  It is pure h-e-a-v-e-n.", "user_id": "LRd5CZ8tkdV2Pa4Zz2pSbw", "business_id": "rT-iPtIXMKj3dTcl87lbOw"}
{"text": "Don't waste your time or money.  My salad had a rotten tomato and a hair (not mine).  My waitress never offered another hairless salad even if I had wanted one.  The broiled flounder wasn't very hot and neither were my steamed veggies.  Both were SO BLAND I could have prepared a better version at home.  My mom had spaghetti with meat sauce and said it was just mediocre.  The owner asked how our meal was when I paid and insisted they use fresh tomatoes.  I'm sure they do but I had to spit mine out.  She discounted our drinks but I'll never be back! This location is closer to home than the original on Linwood Road and I really like the food here.  The staff is very friendly and I love the fact you get a salad with your meal.  I love the oysters, Canadian skinless flounder and the marinated beef strips - those are some of my favorites.  Their tartar sauce is excellent and yes you get to squirt it out of the container versus paying for individual cups like some places.  If you love seafood like I do give it a try.  Remember .....  good seafood isn't cheap and cheap seafood isn't good! Their pizza is always hot & fresh.  I placed on online order last week and somehow when I went to pick it up I had 3 pizza's!  I showed the confirmation email & explained I hadn't hit complete button & I went back and edited my order.  Jay was kind enough to give me those 3 pizzas for the price of one instead of throwing them away.  I thanked him and apologized sincerely.\n\nI will continue to do the business with them ..... it's the best pizza in my opinion! What a wonderful experience!  I am so impressed by this place and I'm mad at myself it took me this long to come.  They have a very large selection of sandwiches and a large salad bar.  My favorite part is getting the half sandwich (any on the menu) and half salad (which is large enough to put your head in).  There are complimentary muffins on the dessert bar and free ice cream too.  Everything is fresh and/or organic.  I'll go any chance I'm over this way. I came here for the first time and was so happy they could customize my bagel to be healthy by making it skinny (cutting a chunk out of the middle making it thinner) and using egg whites.  It was warm, fresh and tasty.\n\nNext I thought I would try one of their Green Mountain coffees - the Island Coconut flavor.  I know what your thinking but stop right there .... give it a whirl.  Wow it is good!  I got so excited about it I craved it for a whole week.\n\nIts such a nice change to a greasy fried breakfast.  I'm glad I went and I will be back! I don't know what took me so long to dine here!!  It was on my radar but I just never made it in until my employer held our Christmas party there.  The tomatoes and basil in the bruschetta were so fresh and tasty.  I can always gauge an Italian restaurant by their Lasagna and I was very pleased with my selection.  I tried a coworkers steak & mushroom over risotto and I've been craving it ever since.  The vanilla bean cheesecake was delightful and I like the fact the slices were large enough to share.  I can't wait to return with my mom! I was staying at Presbyterian Hospital with my boyfriend after surgery and was tired of the food selection downstairs so I thought ..... PIZZA!\n\nI checked online for the nearest location  of Papa John's and I called to make sure they could deliver to the hospital and it was no problem.  I placed my order online and in no time I got the call he was a minute away.  When I made it downstairs the delivery man was already waiting on me!  He was extremely pleasant and personable.  I could have sold the pizza four times before I made it back to the fifth floor!  \n\nThe pizza was still hot and extremely GOOD - we even offered his nurse a piece and she gladly acceptedl.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because I ordered mushrooms on half because my boyfriend doesn't like them and it was on the whole pizza ( I loved it though).", "user_id": "4522K1jh68XVpUsPh-5I7A", "business_id": "xkrhaKM1YtiLEcorBI5zcQ"}
{"text": "I got the fried rice with beef, and it was so-so.  I've had better.  The restaurant was decent andthe staff was friendly and fast.  But the food was just ok, and I have to admit that while I was eating it I was a little worried if I would get sick or not.  \nBut to be fair the other people I was eating with loved their food.  I heard the tempura vegetables were great.  Unfortunatley my experience was just mediocre. Thats the way it goes though, but  I will give them another shot , roll with the punches and try a different dish.  I'll keep you posted. Ooh La La, Capital Grille is the most Ritzy and detail oriented restaurant in Charlotte, to help you understand what I mean allow me to tell a little story:  It was my Girlfriend's Birthday and I wanted to make a good impression on her, so I decided to take her to Capital grille in Uptown Charlotte.  I called and made reservations, they were very nice and completely accommodating over the phone.  We arrive on time for our reservations and we are greeted by the hostess who is the first to tell my girlfriend Happy Birthday, everyone inn the restaurant from the servers to the bus boys said hello to us and wished my girl a happy birthday.  When we arrived at the table it was covered in a very classy looking glitter and decorations specifically yfor the occasion.  They made us feel like movie stars, and she thought I was amazing because I had set all this up, but really it was all Capital Grille. So right away the service has set the scene for us to have an excellent night.\n\nThen came the food, we started with a round of gin and tonics, good, and a crab cake appetizer which was amazing, chunks of perfectly seasoned crab meat, and just enough to wet our appetites for the main course.  She ordered the fillet Mignon, and I got the porterhouse.  It was spectacular.  The meat is aged in a glassed in room, which you can see when you first walk in, and tastes incredibly rich, with many layers of flavor, from the smoked grilled aspect to the texture of the aged beef, ummm, I even took the bone home and gnawed on it the next day, it was that good.  The mashed potatoes were really good too.\n\nCapital grille is perfect for special occasions, a little pricey, but when you're celebrating, this is the place to go all out. In the tradition of full disclosure, I never really liked Quiznos that much anyway....I'm more of a Firehouse or Harris Teeter Hoagie guy, but the other day I was hungry on lunch and decided to give them a try.  The Roast Beef and cheddar looked pretty good.  But it wasn't.  It had a weird sort of taste, and with every other bite or so I would notice these odd little mushroom bits...you know like the canned mushrooms, and the seasoning and added flavors were not to my liking.  Not to mention the after effects....uggggh...never again Quiznos....never again. I'm feeling a little inspired since I've been up all night listening to Slug (from Atmosphere) , so I think I'm going to rap this next review...Wanna Hear it, here it go.\n(While you read this just think of a phat bass line with some cool scratch effects wherever.ever..ever.ever...you see fit)\n\nYo Uh! Yeah! \nCherry House Chinese \n The freshest dishes \nat prices that please\nOrder some shrimp lo mien\n know what I mean\nFresh as can be\nNo OD on MSG.. ya see\nAnd spicy chicken for me\nOoooh Owww! that's hot \nAnd Tasty too\nwith a ton o veggies out the pot\nand a pile o rice...true\nYeaYah..understood\nBig Portions, hot flavors..and the freshy fresh\nfresh ...its all good.\nChicken Wings..crispy\nmouth watering crunch\nGood with the meal\nor save em for lunch\n6 for only $2.99...\nFull belly \nand the change is mine\nCherry House Chinese.... \nYou get my vote  with ease.\n\n-But seriously its really damn good. Fresh shrimp in the Lo Mien, not too much flavoring, (it had just enough), but you know how some Chinese places OD on the MSG, not here. And the portions are huge. Cherry House is inexpensive,scrumpt-didly-umptious, and they deliver. The Spicy chicken came with a ton of rice, not as much chicken as I would have liked but still very good, and spicy, watch out for the chili peppers, they'll burn ya.", "user_id": "RxU2EOtHFNe6EX9T8z8VUA", "business_id": "QMX1ssofSveU3qhVAKLnXA"}
{"text": "If the main character from Fifty Shades of Grey was a glutenous, food-pushing grandmother, Sunday morning at the Mimosa Grill is where she would be enacting her food fantasies, which involve sitting you down and throwing-down with the most epically delicious (pro)portions of crispy bacon, stringy mac-and-cheese, grits, fruit, quiche, potatoes, and anything else that her culinary mind can think of. \n\nJust as you think you can't take anymore, she'll show you things that you have never even thought were possible: made-to-order walnut encrusted french toast (seriously, best french toast ever), creole egg benedict, and whatever else comes to her deliciously profane mind. And you can't but eat anything that she puts before you.\n\nThen, just as your eyes role to the back of your head from the sinful pleasure of overpowering deliciousness, she sucker-punches you with juicy chocolate covered strawberries, bread pudding, cobbler, and all kinds of cookies and brownies--if only to tease you of the sweetness that could have been.\n\nNeedless to say, this brunch will stuff you eight ways from Sunday and have you begging for more. Despite the trembling knees, out of breath gasps, and swears of never eating again, you'll be back. \n\nProbably next Sunday. \n\nAnd you'll again pay $20 for the pleasure (unlimited coffee, tea, orange juice included!). This is where to go when you have one of those impossible to please everyone groups. Combining aspects of Malaysian, Japanese, Chinese, India, and Singaporean cuisine, if you and everyone that you are with are unable to find at least 10 irresistible menu items, then there are greater problems at play here.\n\nThe menu (which is actually a spiral bound BOOK) is filled with appetizing rice, noodles, curries, grilled meats, and sushi items. Depending on the extent of your culinary adventures, some items may be more familiar to you (teriyaki chicken, kung pao chicken, spring rolls) while others are likely to have your tongue twisted (Char Kway Teow, Nasi Nanas). However, regardless of its name, what ever you order will be delicious, plentiful, and addicting.  \n\nI've personally grown very fond of the Char Kway Teow, which is similar to Thai pad see eu (you know what I'm talking about with those wide chewy rice noodles). Unless I haven't eaten all day, one order of this will stuff me into a coma while have HALF left over for tomorrow. No joke. Portions are ridiculous for the price and sure to fill. \n\nI can also recommend for an appetizer the satay tofu, which are fried tofu triangles stuffed (yes, stuffed) with peanut butter, cucumber, and bean spouts. Their soups are also fantastic.\n\nAll the while, the servers providing you this abundant food are friendly, jovial, and even bordering on the down-right bad-ass. There is an older gentleman in particular (who usually drives for delivery) that reminds me of a really cool funny grandpa. He makes me want to order delivery just to hang out a little.\n\nIn all, my only complaint (if it can be called this) is that the portions are almost too big. I love sampling a lot of different things (particularly considering the range of options that they have), but this practice is simply not sustainable without a critical mass of mouths to share with. Hmmm, perhaps I need to make some more food friends... Cherry House is good for two things: quick and inexpensive Chinese food. Don't expect to be blown aware by culinary complexity or innovative dishes and presentations here. But, hey, they carry most of the westernized classics.\n\nUS CULTURE TIP ON THE USAGE OF THE TERM \"CHOW MEIN\":\nI learned from my experience here that there is a difference in the US between East and West coast conceptions of chow mein. On the West coast (where I was raised), chow mein refers to the steamed soft noodles and \"Hong Kong style\" refers to the crispy style fired noodles. However, here on the East coast, \"chow mein\" is assumed to be the crispy Hong Kong style, while \"lo mein\" refers to the soft steamed style. Who knew?\n\nAt Cherry House, however, chow mein seems to refer to a bunch of fried rectangular morsels of friedness. I think they are the ones that you find in soup sometimes. In any case, I was a little let down.\n\nThat said, in a fix it is a perfectly viable option. The lunch combinations are a fantastic option at $6-$8 for main dishes with fried rice and egg roll, spring roll, or crab rangoon. A filling lunch for two coming in at under $13? I've had worse.", "user_id": "KcJ6P3vXpYgYgbYAxi2_2w", "business_id": "NTfUFk8GyOLL1uPbEO-pVg"}
{"text": "Came here for lunch on Memorial Day. They have an outside seating area that is covered which was a huge plus and it is located really close to 7th Street Market. \nI tried a flight of their beers and they were decent but nothing special. I would recommend the red ale or the double IPA. \nWe had their nachos to start which were ok, it is a huge serving that comes with salsa to dip. I had the veggie tacos which were good, they had a crunchy shell covered with a soft tortilla which I actually enjoyed. It came with a side of rice and beans. I really liked the black beans but there was something about the rice that had a bad after taste. \nMy husband ordered the veggie burger and fries. I tried the fries and I liked them but didn't try his burger. He said it was good but again nothing special. I came here for dinner when we were out of town for my girlfriends bachelorette party and it was delicious. We had several bottles of wine and champagne and each tried to order something different on the menu for everyone to try. I ordered filet with risotto which was heavenly. I also was able to try the duck which was equally delicious. \nI will say we were all wearing dresses preparing to go out for the night but I did feel a bit out of place, this place is very 'swanky'. I really debated on how many stars to give. If I could I would have given 3.5. I came here for lunch and I was pleased, not blown away but happy. The decor in some aspects is cool but in others it could use some updating. You can tell they have probably made some changes over the years but not all the ones they need to. Our waitress was super sweet and friendly which was also another plus. \nThey bring bread and oil yo start when you sit down. The bread is actually rolls which I found disappointing, it's served with a slightly spicy oil. We had the goat cheese snd mascarpone dip with marinara and it was delicious. The goat cheese was present but not overwhelming. It comes with toast but I wish it had been served with something more bite size such as crostini etc. I should also mention that we came during lunch time and not dinner so we didn't have the whole menu to pick from. I had the angel hair pasta with tomato basil sauce and it was good, I was happy with it. My husband ordered the penne with vodka sauce and it was also delicious, it had some spice to it as well. I like spice but for some it may have been too much. \nI would eat here again it would not go out of my way to do so. Ordered some food from here to go one evening, not the best but not the worst either. I was more pleased with some items rather than others. We ordered the veggie lo mein which was pretty good and I enjoyed it. The vegetable fried rice was ok but all around pretty bland I thought. We ordered their veggie rolls which were just terrible. The flavor was awful and the wrap was so soft and had no crunch, I couldn't even finish eating one of them. We also ordered the sesame tofu which was honestly the best part of the entire meal and pretty impressive. It tasted just like ordering sesame chicken only tofu instead. I would def. eat some things from here again but I wouldn't jump at the chance either.", "user_id": "GtcVim7Y43ALraAb3ritmQ", "business_id": "ym9QwkmB5ZKTyj7q5huTDw"}
{"text": "There is a same restaurant under the exact address listed under sushiya japan. This is a duplicate. I almost gave this place 1 star, but hey the owners were very nice and cute so I can't do that reason as ratings need to be holistic. My friend was really craving Caribbean food so I did research on yelp and decided on this place because of the high rating. I was SOOO very disappointed. First of all, LACK OF selections, maybe this is an American thing to want to have a couple more options, but to be fair, you can see the menu that is listed under the photos section here, you get like 3 choices. I got the vegetarian platter as well, maybe that's why it's not very good. But I always prefer vegetarian and I've had MUCH MUCH better food elsewhere. I got some kidney beans mixed in with my rice...I feel like I could have cooked myself this with a can of beans dumped into my rice? On top of the kidney beans the veggie platter also comes with string beans...ok they are the best on the my plate. And then it was another selection of veggie that I am not quite sure what it is but this place kinda just reminds me of badly cooked southern food to be honest. But hey, I am going to go back and maybe give it another try on the meat product. As far as veggies goes, not tasty is for sure. This may be the best Asian cuisine place uptown. A nice dining experience, responsive waiter service, price is mostly between $7.99-10.99. Very flavorful, food comes out pretty fast. The best part is it actually has a nice taste, unlike most Chinese places that all pretty much taste the same. Presentation is also better here. I would suggest this place if you are actually looking for a comfortable dining experience instead of a grab to go take out Chinese lunch in uptown. Nothing special but OHHH SOOO CHEAPP!!! Also, a tad better than a hole in the wall Chinese places. The food? Pretty good, not stellar but for the price you can't beat it! I always get lo-mein, singapore noodle, or pan fried flat noodle. YUM YUM YUM. If you are uptown and want cheap Chinese food that doesn't taste cheap, this is your go to place. Find another place in Charlotte that you can get cheaper Chinese food and I'd be amazed! Nothing special but OHHH SOOO CHEAPP!!! Also, a tad better than a hole in the wall Chinese places. The food? Pretty good, not stellar but for the price you can't beat it! I always get lo-mein, singapore noodle, or beef chow fun.  If you are uptown and want cheap Chinese food that doesn't taste cheap, this is your go to place. However, if you want quality Chinese food, I'd suggest another restaurant on the same block that is much bigger and a better dining experience, Cuisine Malaya. Also, I am not sure why this place is rated 2 dollar signs, I'd say it is more like 1. Also one last tip, I learned that you can request lunch portion on pretty much ANYTHING on their menu, even the chef's special, so make sure you ask for it if you don't want as big of a portion, it'll save you a good $2 or so on each item. Lastly, try their beef chow fun, OMGGG, awesome. Not the best I've ever had but out of all the entrees I tried from this restaurant, they nailed the beef chow fun. Tender beef, well separated noodle, paired with snow peas, a bit of sprouts, carrots and diced mushroom. The veggies are all cooked crunchy. Nicely flavored not too salty, NO sour taste like some take out Chinese places. Worth my $8.95.", "user_id": "6PO3R6ZUw8r6WfRnzlexnA", "business_id": "4glD2-evDFddHjQaEVpCPQ"}
{"text": "Man I had really high hopes for Luce.  I don't know maybe I had my expectations set to high or maybe it was just another restaurant week mishap.  Well here is the good the service was great - the atmosphere was great - the dessert (tirimisu) pretty delicious, but everything else just fell short. \nI ordered a dirty martini (received a straight-up martini with a twist of lemon)  the boyfriend ordered a long island iced tea (we all tried to figure out what kind of drink they actually made him tasted like bourbon)  but I could live with the drink mishap I'm happy I had my vodka.\n \nNow for the food... I started with the panzanella salad there wasn't much taste in the dish it was under seasoned just plain. I  ordered the manicotti for my dinner - I wish I would have known before I took a bite how hot this dish was I could barely feel my tongue after that.  The manicotti was ok but not memorable.  The dish that not only looked really disappointing but as I was told by my guests I brought along with me it was tasteless too.  I'm not going to lie their chicken dishes looked like a lean cuisine you know those teeny tiny chicken breasts that come in lean cuisine meals well folks that is exactly what they got.  Although that was a sad dish the pork chop my boyfriend ordered was delicious and the veal shank was quite tasty as well.  Will I be back ...hmm not sure yet. Just when I was about to give up on good sushi in Charlotte my neighbor introduced me to FUJO or what he calls his secret Chinese restaurant. \n\nFujo is tucked away in the Wachovia building downtown. The menu is huge you can try anything from one of their more exotic sushi rolls like the Cajun Roll - (Shrimp & Crawfish Inside: Topped w/ Spicy Crab and Cajun Spice) to authentic and tasty Chinese dishes like chicken with garlic sauce. The hardest part is choosing what to eat. \n\nDid I mention that they serve my favorite wine here I haven't seen it in any other restaurant around yet...Sophia Coppola's sparkling white wine it's served in a little pink can. That just makes the experience that much better. \n\nYou never have to wait for a table and its a great place for a group dinner before heading out for some drinks uptown. Yummy - again just one of those places i've driven by a thousand times.. just took some good yelp reviews to get me to stop on in.  \nLet's start with the service - superb our waiter Ian knows everything and anything on the menu...I highly recommend you listen to his suggestions.\nIan brought us a taste of the curry which was good - it wasn't quite Thai but also wasn't quite Indian it was a nice mix.  Then he brought me every type of noodle in house so I could pick a noodle dish.\n\nThe menu here is huge and it can be hard to make a decision - so try a little bit of everything like I did.  Did I mention they also serve sushi and it's awesome.  I'm glad I finally gave this place a try...I'll be stopping by quite a bit. WOW!  This has got to be the best experience I've had dining in Charlotte.  From the service, the food, the drinks everything was just perfect.   Carpe Diem has been bookmarked on my yelp for awhile now I'm so glad I finally checked it out.  I had some good friends in town who are also big foodies and I really wanted to impress them - kind of a risk taking them somewhere I've never been myself...but life's about taking risks right?  \n\nIt was 8:30ish on a Friday night and we had no trouble getting a table - when I walked in I was a little nervous that we were under-dressed and that the hostess might give us dirty looks but I was wrong...yes I think we were under-dressed but they treated us like queens.  Our server (I think her name was Shelly) was terrific she kept us entertained all night and gave us great suggestions for dinner.  We all started with some kick\n a_ _  dirty martini's seriously just ask to taste their olives they brine them and they are delicious.  Next up a fantastic cheese plate and Thai style carpaccio.  Carpaccio is one of my favorite dishes of all time I loved the way they prepared it here.  Next a fine bottle of Malbec and dinner time.\nWe all made good choices I don't know who's dish was the best I opted for the pork dish it's a new addition to the menu it was a German dish with red cabbage, breaded pork, spaetzle, and a sunny side up egg sounds weird but every part of the dish worked.   The shrimp cous cous and mushroom bolognese were very tasty as well.\n\nI can't wait to go back this is definitely number 1 on my list of restaurants in the Queen City.", "user_id": "ED6n40WmZJm0AvsKkG7iaw", "business_id": "z24h6ZYnZiWjlDTuLXG9jw"}
{"text": "The food is delicious and wine nicely paired with each entree is a plus. Each entree is well thought out. The presentation is great too. \n\nThe service was good, but a tad distant. The bread server arrived way before our actual server...they need to work on that. It looks like the service is notorious for being the weak link at this place.\n\nThe bathrooms are downstairs and only one at a time. Don't wait until the last minute because there may be a line.\n\nGreat location and a great place to start your night. Make reservations since it can get filled quickly due to the small space. I can definitely see why this place gets busy after 6pm. After a hard day of work, Blue will make all stress take a back seat. \n\nI really liked the use of the space and the different seating areas. They created a nice atmosphere and colorful mini floor tiles.\n\nThe hostess and servers were very welcoming and friendly throughout the entire experience. The wine and appetizers were great! I didn't stay for dinner, but one day I will be back (with some cash to burn). Looking for a good lunch stop? Try Mama Ricotta's. It's in a convenient location just south of Uptown or just outside the Dilworth area...perfect for a quick business lunch. I think other people have the same idea because there were a lot of business-dressed patrons filling every seat.\n\nIf you plan on talking to secure that business deal, sit outside (as long as the weather is accommodating). It's rather loud and difficult to hear your party indoors and I found myself smiling and nodding across the way without really knowing what my colleague was saying half the time (shhh, don't tell).\n\nThe food was good...not spectacular. The salmon that comes on the salad is of large proportion. The sandwiches actually looked the best out of all the dishes at our table! I had the capellini pomodoro with the tomato basil sauce...okay. The rolls were rolls...not french bread, but were good. \n\nI'll give it another try because other Yelpers have had such a good experience here...and perhaps I'll order one of their sandwiches. Pretty cheap, pretty good. They offer delivery in a certain areas (so call to verify). Delivery was non-stop the night I went in and a few dining in.\n\nThe space was small and the restaurant smelled of their seafood dishes. The service was good and fast. Want to take your special date to a posh dinner? Dress fancy and get ready for a dining experience at Carpe Diem. \n\nI had to take Todd W's advice...goat cheese salad! The food was delicious! We ordered the cheese plate to start. It was proportioned well and the cream, the hard cheese, paired with the fruit and honey were just right. For the main entree, I ordered the vegetarian couscous and hubs got the veggie special of the day. Both were made fresh to order and I savored each bite. It was so good that even as full as I had become, I couldn't stop eating until it was almost gone. The wine list had plenty to choose from to make a nice pairing with your entrees as well. \n\nThey try to source what they can from local farms and they make a menu to reflect what is fresh for the season.\n\nI love having a 2-hour dinner without feeling rushed; it makes me feel high class. The server was very nice and attentive, giving us time to enjoy the experience.\n\nSave your Benjamin's and when you're ready to splurge treat yourself to a night at Carpe Diem!", "user_id": "LP0bl3GKToABt3lnpSvA2w", "business_id": "-Am2JVkb7nwvBAUwSugG0A"}
{"text": "I was looking forward to my first visit to Aquavina but came away disappointed.   I'm quite easy to please food wise so this experience was a surprise to me.  This restaurant is relatively pricey so perhaps my expectations were high based on what I perceived would be value for my dollar.\n\nWe dined on a surprisingly quiet Friday night. Even so, the service was adequate - nothing more, nothing less.  Not very friendly and welcoming, just adequate.\n\nAs for the food.  We started with the blue crab fondue served with french baguette toasts, which was absolutely fabulous.  I'd definitely recommend this dish but don't eat too much or you'll have no room left for the entrees to come.   \n\nEntrees were ribeye with roquefort cheese sauce, and my companion ordered the petit filet mignon.  Sides are ordered separately; we selected grilled asparagus and potato gratin. The portions are quite generous but the presentation was way off for me.  My ribeye arrived on a big plate with a large portion of roquefort smeared across the top, looking quite lonely without something (anything) to make it look appealing.  Yes, I know the sides are served separately so that limits how the dish might be displayed, but more could have been done to appeal to the eye.  \n\nAll in all, the food was adequate (except the delicious fondue!).  But I expected a much better experience for the price.  I don't mind spending money to go out and have a delicious meal and lovely experience.  But I do expect just that - a delicious meal and a lovely experience. Yes, 5 stars for this wonderful restaurant. It's now one of my Charlotte favorites and I'd urge readers to seize the day (ok, had to say it!) and give my new fave a try.\n\nThe atmosphere is lovely - white tablecloth service, beautiful oversized floral paintings/photos adorn the walls, polished wood throughout and faux flickering candles on the tables. A low murmur could be heard throughout the room but it was not overpowering (not a fan of noisy restaurants).\n\nThe service is outstanding.  Attentive, smiling, helpful and friendly from the host staff to the wait staff.\n\nAnd the food?  Heavenly.  I went with a group of 6 and all were unanimous in praise of their meals.  Warm sourdough bread with sweet butter that melted in my mouth was a good place to start.  If you like goat cheese, you'll want to try the warm goat cheese salad with apricot jalapeno vinaigrette dressing. The goat cheese is encrusted in hazelnuts and the flavor and texture are outstanding.\n\nFor an entree, I ordered the pork chop prepared medium (first time in years I've had a pork chop and I was a bit nervous to try).  Marinated in apple cider and grilled, served with a divine jalapeno and goat cheese cornbread pudding and carrots, this was a pork chop for the ages.  Oh my goodness...I'm serious here though a bit effusive.  It was really that good.  Even better was the cornbread pudding and some type of salsa verde on top that brought all the flavors of the meal together.  I would order it again were it not for my desire to try every other selection during my next visit.  Which will be very soon.\n\nDessert selection was Belgian chocolate cake with a raspberry sauce.  This is my favorite combination of dessert flavors and it was quite good.\n\nI skipped my normal girlie martini so can't report on the skill of the barkeep here but the wine list had very good selections and thankfully I chose well on this evening.\n\nEnjoy great food?  Add Carpe Diem to your list!", "user_id": "Ab0-jCJ2eWQ-Xnd_lI76cg", "business_id": "G5dIek0rXPTHlqlJpCNmpw"}
{"text": "We went to this resturant for our anniversary. I loved the atmosphere.  It was like we had gone back into time.  I think that is the idea.  This is an old house with a lot of elegance.  The service was excellent.  We did the bistro menu which is three courses plus sorbet.  The first course was the best. Fried green tomato with a crab cake.  I have never had a fried green tomato like this one.  It was absolutely incredible. The crab cake was also excellent. The ribeye was OK. It wasn't my favorite part of the meal but it was good. I wasn't expecting such a smoked flavor.  The dessert was fabulous.  They gave me a rose and gave us glasses of champagne because it was our anniversary. Very romantic pace for dinner. We were greeted with \" Happy Annversiary\" and two glasses of Champagne.  I though the champagne was actually quite delicious.  We had lobster-crab cakes for appetizers.  There was quite a bit of lobster in the cakes and they were scrumptious.  We shared a 10 oz Filet  which was plenty for us.  It was cooked to perfection.  We had scalloped potatoes and asparagus which we took home left overs.  They had one of our favorite wines from Chandon Domaine which I have not seen in a resturant before. They brought us out 2 small desserts: one on each end of plate with Happy Anniversary in the middle.  They took our picture with their camera and provided us with the picture.  Our waiter was superb along with the service.  The managers made sure we were happy by checking on us several times. Probably the worst Mother's Day brunch in Charlotte.   I felt horrible that my husband paid 39 dollars each  for basically an omelette.   The fruit was mediocre. The salad wasn't good. The vegetable station wasn't appealing.  The beef I got was so tough I couldn't chew it. So we ordered omelettes.  There very very few ingredients to choose from for the omelet so I ordered a sausage, mushroom, cheddar cheese one and my husband ordered an bacon, mushroom, omelette.  There were very few vegetables to order with it.  We couldn't tell which omelette was which because we couldn't see the bacon or sausage. I think I got the wrong one because even once in a while I tasted a bite of bacon. We laughed instead of cry when we left because we basically paid close to 100 dollars for omelettes and crepes with tiny deserts when the day before we had an excellent breakfast at another Resturant for about 27.00.  We sure wish we had gone somewhere else. Music was good when they played.  Service was good but kept trying to convince us how good the food was when at best it was mediocre.  I don't think we will come here any time again too soon.  It's a shame. I have fond memories of coming here before after Broadway shows but I don't think we will go anytime again real soon. Read so many reviews, I didn't know what to expect.  The resturant wasn't as fancy as I thought it would be but in a nice way. My husband and I both got grilled grape salad minus the onions.  The salad was very fresh and not over done. The husband got scallops that he thought was very good but once he tasted my fried chicken, he knows what he will get next time. I don't usually get fried food but since the chicken seems to be hottest item, I had to try. It truly is indescribable. It was so, so good.  I don't usually even like mashed potatoes and I loved these.  The saut\u00e9ed Spanish was also yummy. The chocolate ganache pie  to share was a perfect way to end our dinner.  Also had my favorite type of wine. We will be going back to this resturant.", "user_id": "Ie9LBe0l2VhDc0ClKDGiig", "business_id": "USdRzNk14UdjZWFgBJb0wA"}
{"text": "My friend and I came here for an elegant dinner. The atmosphere is very nice.  A jacket is required and no cell phones are allowed in the dinning room.  This historic house is beautiful and well maintained. Much of the decor is original. The service was spectacular. \n\nDespite the nice atmosphere, I wasn't very impressed with the food. We did the seven course Chef's tasting menu and ordered a bottle of wine. It was a nice experience, but the dessert (an upscale strawberry shortcake) was the best part of the meal. \n\nOverall, it was good but not great. If you're interested in a romantic dinner in a charming home, I recommend Fig Tree. It's a similar experience with better food for less money. This review refers to their brunch. I have never been here for another meal, but the brunch is excellent. Overall, it is my favorite brunch spot in the city. I love to go in the spring or fall when the weather is nice, so I can sit on the patio. \n\nThey offer a buffet and unlimited small plates for $20. You can also upgrade your meal to include mimosas. The buffet is delicious. I love the shrimp and grits and the Mac and Cheese. I also like the way they provide the bacon. It's in a large pan and they have pieces that are crispy and pieces that haven't been cooked as long, so you can pick the option that appeals to you.  \n\nIn addition to the buffet, they also offer several small plates: omelets, French toast, etc. I like being able to go to the buffet and to select items that are prepared for me. The restaurant has a very appealing atmosphere. This is the first place that I take people for brunch. It's a great experience and a great value. I enjoyed my dining experience here. The salt and pepper chicken wings were excellent! They brine them in vinegar and garlic for a few days, then deep fry them and season them with salt and pepper. It was simple and delicious!! I'll definitely be back for them.  We also had an order of Greek fries, which are potato wedges seasoned with oregano. They were also good.  They weren't exceptional (like the chicken wings), but they were tasty and a good accompaniment to the wings. One member of our party ordered the nachos, which were average. I wouldn't recommend them.  \n\nWe sat outside on the patio, which was very pleasant. There are a bunch of bars/restaurants on this little strip and it's a bit secluded. So, it felt like we were in a small neighborhood, not in the middle of uptown.  I definitely recommend sitting on the patio if the weather permits. The inside seemed a bit dated and stuffy. \n\nOur waitress was very friendly and she knew the menu well (which I always appreciate). We went on a Wednesday, so the wine was half-off! The selection is limited, but I enjoyed the discount.  \n\nI definitely recommend this place. The chicken wings alone are worth the trip.  The restaurant is also located across from the new baseball stadium for the Charlotte Knights. Stop by before or after a game! I had my birthday dinner here a few years ago. There were about 8 of us. The staff was extremely accommodating. The atmosphere is classy, without being pretentious. Based on the crowd and the decor,  I imagine this place would be great for happy hour too.   \n\nThe food was good. I had the scallops, which were pretty standard. But a few people let me sample their entrees. The pork chop and the fried chicken were very good.  This is a great place to celebrate a special occasion.", "user_id": "tha1bsWQNbDTnHYMk48vGA", "business_id": "USdRzNk14UdjZWFgBJb0wA"}
{"text": "I wish I'd read the recent reviews before venturing here on a Saturday evening. I should've known something was up when we were one of only four parties in the restaurant on a Saturday evening at 7:00 p.m.\n\nAfter being seated, it took our waiter forever to come to our table. The fella and I both had a really hard time understanding him because of his heavy accent, so that clouded some of our evening. He was nice enough when he was at the table, but it took him FOREVER to ask us for our drink order, bring us our drinks, ask us for our food order, etc. He also addressed us as \"lady\" and \"gentleman,\" which was odd.\n\nThe food was fine. I got the pork, and the fella got the halibut. Fine. The end.\n\nWe went to the bar after dinner to have a drink, and the bartender disappeared into the back just as we sat down. We waited 5-10 minutes for her to come back, and when she didn't, we walked over to BLT Steak where we got much better bar service.\n\nWhen I think about the other \"fine dining\" restaurants in Charlotte, Blue really doesn't hold a candle to their service or atmosphere. What a bummer to spend that much money and be that underwhelmed. I'm not one to dish out five stars for just any restaurant, but Carpe Diem is definitely deserving.  The fella and I made reservations for a Saturday at 6:45 and stopped by an hour early to have a pre-dinner drink at the bar.\n\nWe walked in and were promptly greeted by the hostess and manager.  We grabbed a seat at the semi-circular bar; the fella ordered his usual dirty martini with Tito's Vodka, and I had a specialty cocktail that I can't remember the name of, but it was like a gin and tonic with cucumber, which made it even more refreshing.  Our bartender was engaging without being omnipresent, and after about 20 minutes, more people started to filter into the bar area, which was cozy - there were not only stools at the bar, but also comfy looking loveseats and chairs around the perimeter - and almost had a Tuscan feel.\n\nAfter our drink, we moved into the dining room and got the best seat in the house!  There's one table in almost a cubby hole with curtains that I guess you could close if you wanted, and it's an awesome seat.  Even more awesome was the food.  We got the beef carpaccio to start ($10), and I loved the mustard and capers gave it just enough tang without being too spicy, and the ciabatta bread was a perfect accompaniment.  For dinner, I got the pork tenderloin ($25) with fried plantains - the entire reason I got the dish - and BBQ baked Sea Island peas.  Now, I hate regular peas, but these had some sweet onions mixed in, and I ate every bite of food on my plate.  The fella got the Scottish salmon ($25), and he said it plus the scallion-ginger relish on top was pretty darn delicious.  We checked out the dessert menu, but we were too stuffed to try anything.  Also, our waitress was very nice and down to earth and came over the perfect amount of times to check on us without being annoying.\n\nSo, not only was the food amazing, but the atmosphere is also right up my alley - it's good food without being too snooty.  We, like a lot of other customers, were in nice jeans, but it certainly didn't feel like it was fancy.  If you wanted to dress up, that'd be fine, and if you wanted to be a little more casual, that'd be fine, too.  We can't wait to go back.", "user_id": "He6ZibRNyBAGvC-QHOrPkw", "business_id": "eaqJQP6bp7rQJQt5KqfvxQ"}
{"text": "Parking may be tight in this historic neighborhood, but charm is large.  We happened to find a spot close to a beautiful vintage Chevrolet truck, which may be the restaurant mascot.\nWhen we entered the restaurant, this man, who was big on presence, strode toward us and showed us to a booth.  He told us who our server would be and ensured our comfort.\nA server arrived and took our drink orders. We also requested an appetizer, the black bean hummus.  We could have it with a kick or not.  Of course, I chose the kick.  OMG!  This was the best hummus that I have had.  It was served on a bed of shredded lettuce and chopped tomato, that added to the goodness of this dish. The pita bread served as a delectable anchor.\nBecause we had ordered an appetizer, I chose a lighter meal for my entree.  I requested a chef salad sans meat with blue cheese dressing.  Fresh and loaded with vegetables, it was.  My husband got the crawfish burrito and enjoyed it as well.\nWanna come back here.  What a charming spot. Cozy and welcoming.  This is my impression upon entering Hartigan's.  The menu features typical pub favorites, such as nachos, wraps ad burgers.  I chose the veggie burger without the bun and, dare I admit this?  Tater tots!  Ok, Ms. Healthy likes to splurge, too!  The burger arrived with tomato and lettuce, and there must have been a whole bag of tots on my plate because I couldn't finish them.  Friendly and helpful servers, too.  The only thing that I did not care for was the bar's playlist of current, top forty music. I went here with my dinner group of 10 people. We were given the most delicious bread with a nicely spiced olive oil.  I ordered the ravioli, which was cheese filled and offered a choice of 3 sauces.   I chose butter and sage.  Very good and quite a sizeable portion.   I did leave one ravoili on the plate to be lady like ; )  But, I wish that I had better less greedy so that I could have enjoyed leftovers the next day! I went here with my vegetarian/vegan friends.  We had a large crowd, but the nice folks at Cuisine Malaya made plenty of room for us, even added tables at the last minute.\nThe really nice thing is that you get a free glass of wine with check-in.  That always scores big with me.\nBut, even more than that, the menu offers vegetarian options, and the food is good.  I ordered Kung Pao Tofu.  Crispy, plentiful tofu was presented in a spicy sauce.  But, of course I added more heat.  There was also a choice given between fried, white and brown rice.\nOur group was very impressed and are looking forward to another visit. I like Fortune Cookie for lunch!  Their restaurant may be tiny, but their staff is friendly and the service quick.  My favorite entree is the broccoli with garlic sauce.  The sauce has spicy flavor, and the broccoli is firm and fresh.  Their fried rice is decent, and you can have a choice between their egg roll, which features pork, and their vegetarian spring roll.  A bit disappointing is their sesame tofu, due to the sauce being a bit thin and without the almost candied flavor of other sesame sauces that I have enjoyed.  Still, Fortune Cookie is still a good bet for your money.  I will continue to order my beloved broccoli with garlic sauce. Beautiful interior, excellent service, divine food.  That is all that I really need to say.  However, there are mentionable aspects that set this restaurant apart from others.\nCarpe Diem is the quintessential date night restaurant.  It features romantic lighting, a carved ceiling and large paintings of flowers.  What could be sexier than that?  \nWe had reservations and were seated immediately.  There were several nice wine selections by the glass, and, although they were pricey, they gave you a darn good pour.  In fact, one glass each took us through dinner.\nWe were brought the most delicious bread with butter.  I rarely eat bread, but when I sampled theirs, I ate one and a half pieces.  Bad girl!\nI was pleased to see that they featured Anson Mills products on their menu.  And, even more delighted with the offerings of vegetarian and vegan selections. They even had a vegetarian special for the night.  How thoughtful!\nI did  order that vegetarian special.  It was a tart with a whole grain crust, covered with tomatoes, asparagus, cheese and a perfectly cooked over easy egg.  Phenomenal!  My date ordered the Anson Mills rice grits dish that featured their sea island red peas and Gouda cheese.  He chose the mushroom option instead of the shrimp.  Again, a stellar dish.  \nA five star rating seems skimpy with this kind of quality.  I rate them an entire solar system!", "user_id": "8uOmnlKFYIPkNCn1v8-DVg", "business_id": "ePP0Eqz8JKSbtdt2phiB4A"}
{"text": "Came here the other day for lunch with a co-worker. I'm not a big \"hot dog\" guy...in fact, I haven't had a hot dog in ages....\n\nI ordered two hot dogs all the way with fries....\nThe hotdogs were AWESOME..!! Maybe it's because I haven't had them in a while...but it's more likely that they are just that damn good! \n\nThe fries: I LOVE crinkle cut fries....so simple, but yet so good!!\n\nIf your in the area and can't decide on what to eat for lunch...walk on over to Green's...great bang for your buck...\n\nI also saw that they have a breakfast menu...I will be stopping by one of these days for a quick breakfast sandwhich... Ordered some take out on Sunday night. \nI would actually give this place 3.5 stars if it allowed me to.\n\nI ordered the following:\nWonton noodle soup 3/5\nChicken lo Mein 4/5\nEgg rolls 4/5 good but small\nChicken with broccoli 2/5 -- this is usually my go to and I was pretty disappointed. Chicken and broccoli were cooked fine, but the sauce was very \"pinkish/orangish\" vs the standard darker brown sauce in accustomed to. It just didn't taste right. Idk how else to explain it.\n\n\nI will give them another shot next time I want Chinese take out. It will ultimately let me know if I will continue to order from there, or if I need to start looking for a new takeout spot. I had been wanting to try this place out since I first got to Charlotte so when I saw they were participating in restaurant week I made a reservation right away ($30 for a 3 courses). We came here last Saturday night with our friend Paul who had never been here before either. \n\nWhile RW can sometimes take away from the experience certain restaurants would typically provide, it's a great opportunity to see what the restaurant might be all about without walking out of there with a $200 tab. What it really comes down to at a place like Carpe Diem, $30 would typically get you just an entr\u00e9e. So you can look at it however you would like, but pretty much just tell myself that I get a free appetizer and desert with my meal.\n\nAll 3 of us participated in the 3 for $30 - However, since they were offer their full menu as well, we started our meal by sharing the seared rare tuna as well as the steamed mussels. Both were VERY good. \n\nI then had the potato soup. It had a little bit of truffle oil and what they call \"duck bacon\". Paul and I both agreed that there is only one type of bacon in this world and it comes from animal that goes \"oink oink\" haha. With that said, the soup was tasty and of course I inhaled the entire thing. I then had the pork chop - I would have to say this this was just average. However the mashed dumpling squash that came with it was very very good. It might have been the highlight of the entire entr\u00e9e. I had a bite of the hanger steak as well as the fried chicken and those were both delicious. Of the 3 entrees that came out I would say the pork chop came in last place. \n\nFor dessert I had the coffee cr\u00e8me brulee. For my liking, the top was a little over cooked/torched - I really had to press down to break it with my spoon - but I didn't mind it. The custard was delicious so it kind of makes up for it.\n\nSince meeting Paul, he's been really teaching us a whole lot when it come to wine. There's a reason why he's the \"wine guy\". He's picked up on the types that we like and brought a GREAT bottle of wine to dinner for all of us to enjoy (THANKS PAUL!!) Overall, I had a great evening and I got to enjoy CD with GREAT COMPANY. \n\nI can't wait to come back and try this place again!", "user_id": "1K50PvXa6l5PBXZXhzkB-g", "business_id": "LT0AgHTpDifuHSXgyLmJwg"}
{"text": "As with most things in life, you get what you pay for. Green's is an old staple of uptown Chatlotte's breakfast and lunch scene. The menu consist of burgers, hot dogs, fries, etc.   The set up is very basic. You go to the counter, order your food, slide to the other end of the counter to pay. Then you pick up your food at the counter. No waitresses. You are on your own. Fine by me, as my inner food diva is easily suppressed when a meal is under $6. I usually get two hot dogs for lunch and a soda. They are always warm. The bun stays together. Decent hot dog for a  decent price. I've had a bacon cheese biscuit for breakfast as well as sandwich. Both were just okay. My issue is that the cheese isn't one bit melted, which means that it isn't hot enough. Nothing taste especially great. Just average. So if you're looking for a quick lunch uptown and don't want to blow your budget on lunch, Green's is the place for you. I came out to watch the Hornets game during Game 6 of the 2016 NBA Finals. Despite there being a crowd, service did not suffer and our waiter was quick and attentive. I wasn't particularly hungry and ordered the Mexican Street Tacos. They were tiny - with a speck of fish, regular old hot sauce, and some slaw. They were disappointing to say the least and if I were being a diva, I would've sent them back. I would discourage anyone from ordering these disappointing mini flavorless tacos. My friend ordered chips and guacamole. It was served in a tiny bowl that you would see in an elementary cafeteria for your sides. NOT what you would expect for an appetizer. It was the size you would expect if you ordered guacamole on something else. I'll give this place another shot later, but the food needs to get up to par with the restaurant's cool atmosphere and service. Mama Ricotta's is consistently flavorful with good service. Normally, I'm here for lunch and get the pasta primavera. They are generous with the vegetables and portion size. The meat option to add to the primavera is not worth it, as I find the chicken as well as the shrimp to be rather bland. Additionally, the wait it never long and the staff is friendly. For $9, this is an economical lunch option.\n\nDuring dinner, the line isn't usually too long. The food is delicious and the pastas are very hearty. I recommend the lasagna, as the portion size is filling. My favorite appetizer is the goat cheese and mascarpone dip. If you're not sharing, this could be a meal in itself. Best part of any meal are the garlic rolls. 2 bites size, warm, soft, and garlicky of course. Really good experience here, but not going to be my newest food addiction. The house salad included strawberries, feta cheese, and pumpkin seeds, which I inhaled. They had enough salt/pepper on the salad as well as balsamic dressing done right. I also had the shrimp & grits, which had pinto beans. That was unique, but flavored well and the shrimp were large and w/out a tail. A vegetarian option that subbed mushroom for shrimp was available. My friend had the duck confit and was pleased. Their butter for the bread was a bit salty. Service was great, as the waitress had an impressive command over an expansive menu. Drinks were tasty, but weak. Overall, I see why this place is hyped. Everything was really flavorful and made from quality ingredients and the service is second to none.", "user_id": "EC2X5-sLpLZAXWvrCiMwDg", "business_id": "LT0AgHTpDifuHSXgyLmJwg"}
{"text": "I've been hearing about this place for years and so glad I finally got there. My husband and I arrived around 5 on a Gorgeous Monday afternoon. It was pretty empty, which I welcomed, since it's such a small place and I've heard wait times can be long! It's even smaller and darker than I imagined. I appreciate it for what it is - a great, historic neighborhood pub and restaurant. That being said, I don't think the food is anything too exceptional, but it is good for pub-like food - my 4 stars mostly goes to the atmosphere and experience. \n\nThey have a selection of local beers on tap- there were options from Noda, Sycamore, Triple C, wooden robot and Sugar Creek. Around $5-$6 per pint. We split the jerk chicken quesadillas and the London Broil sandwich, after reading rave reviews. Both were tasty. Definitely add the onions, mushrooms and peppers on the London Broil- otherwise you're doing it wrong. Because it comes coated with a melty Swiss cheese and you want all the substance you can get. Also, get the Cajun fries. \n\nOh, and watch out for the pole in the ladies bathroom! We stopped on in after an event at Discovery Place. It was relatively busy, as it was a Friday night, but the restaurant is huge and can accomodate many parties. They have a great bar/table area, and then more booths/tables towards the back of the restaurant. Right now they have a great deal going on for their beer samples where you get 6 samples for $5. Their menu offers a wide variety so it appeals to vegetarians, meat/burger lovers, those looking for smaller portions, and even has some good looking desserts as well. I had the waldorf chicken salad, which was pretty good. The baked apple crisps were a unique change from the norm. My husband had the 2 am burger, which comes with a fried egg, bacon and hashbrowns - it was a nice, thick burger and really appeals to you if you are hungry. The fries were ok - nothing special. Service was ok, as it took 20 minutes to get our beers delivered, but it was a busy Friday, and apparently the bar was low on glasses. I've heard a great deal of hype about Carpe Diem, and I confess, it is warranted. Great family-owned restaurant and great experience all around.\n\nIt is clear that this restaurant does well, and has many regulars who attend. The food and service was top notch. You never have to worry about having an empty water glass, or even bread bowl. They will refill your bread bowl infinite times (huge plus). I thought the bread was decent - could have been seasoned more (I say this despite the fact I ate 3 pieces). \n\nThey have an extensive cocktail list - all between $10 and $12. They don't offer a huge selection of wines by the glass; probably 4-5 glass options of red and white. You're better off ordering a bottle. \n\nI came in set on ordering the fried chicken because that is what people rave about and it's been on their menu for 20+ years. I was mentally prepared to not even look at other options. However, I then glanced at the menu and saw the duck confit option over pumpkin waffles that couldn't be ignored - so we were set on that. And then, I was just craving some scallops. \n\nThe crispy fried duck confit leg should be your go to choice. It comes over two triangle pumpkin waffles with maple butter, atop crispy kale. I don't know how, but somehow the kale works in this dish, and works well. The crispy duck is amazing fall off the bone. It was so tender and flavorful. I had to just take a few bites off the duck confit itself to savor the flavor. I don't mean to undermine the scallops in this review. They were still very delicious - atop a medium sized crunchy piece of pancetta, a handful of brussel sprouts and parsnip puree. SO GOOD!! But the duck confit wins in originality, creativity and all around awesomeness.\n\nwe didn't get dessert this time - maybe next time. I'll be back, Carpe Diem!", "user_id": "8zDOp-XhH7cx3sVhstdGgA", "business_id": "ePP0Eqz8JKSbtdt2phiB4A"}
{"text": "Great place for lunch when you're craving soul food in the Queen City.\n\nI came here with a coworker for lunch, and had the fried shrimp po boy and macaroni and cheese.  Runs for about $7ish dollars.  The mac and cheese was okay, nothing special, and the po boy was exactly what you would expect it to be.  The cornbread is good, but for some reason I still prefer Boston Market's..... ha.\n\nAll in all it was a satisfying lunch, but nothing that I would go crazy over. My first experience with Ethiopian food was at this restaurant.\n\nI wasn't really sure what to expect, and what came out was definitely not what I was thinking, lol.  Literally it was a giant round plate with a strange looking bubbly/holey bread with what looked pretty much like already-been-chewed meats, vegetables, and lentils.  That's the only way I can describe it.  And on top of that, I got another plate of bread (which turned out to be the injera) with what I can only describe as looking like rags.\n\nTo my surprise, this strange looking food was actually quite delicious.  I enjoyed the experience of having to use the injera (bread) to pick up the different meats and such.  The meat and the lentils were very very flavorful and different from anything I'd ever had before. \n\nIt's probably not something I could handle eating more than once every couple of months, but it's a great type of food to socialize over and actually kinda fun at the same time :P 4.5 stars, rounded up for excellent service.\n\nLovely restaurant owned by two sisters for the last 20-something years in the Elizabeth area.  Their menu is what adrove me to bookmark this spot and eventually try it out today, finally!  A short Uber ride later, we arrived to an almost-empty restaurant on a Tuesday evening, which eventually became more filled as the evening went on.  The crowd seemed like the business crew, since I recognized all the finance and tech speak that was going around at all the tables.\n\nOur server was extremely friendly, patient, and helpful.  She always kept coming back to check on us - gotta love that Southern hospitality!\n\nWe started off with 3 appetizers:\n- Grilled octopus - probably one of the smallest pieces of grilled octopus in the form of an appetizer I've ever seen.  However, it was of a good texture and cooked fairly well, though it could have been slightly more tender.\n- Beef carpaccio - I would not recommend this if you are not a mustard fan.  It's covered in a tangy, slightly spicy mustard.  The beef itself is sliced so thin that you hardly taste anything except the mustard - probably the only downside of this dish.\n- Mussels - the broth is flavorful and different from the typical white wine and garlic both and the crostini that came with it was amazing.  However, I just wasn't all that impressed by the mussels - they could have been infused with more flavor from the broth and the texture of the mussels were way softer than I am used to - they basically fell apart when I tried to take them out of the shell.\nOverall, I'd have to say the apps were a 3-4 star quality in my personal opinion.\n\nFor my entree, I chose the venison, cooked medium rare and loved it.  Everything about this dish was good, from the well-seasoned, perfectly cooked venison to the very flavorful kale and pancetta.  This dish is quite a bit tangy what with the wine/grape sauce, but I love tangy food so this was great for me.\n\nWe went a little wild on dessert and ordered three.  The toasted coconut cake with ice cream was nothing short of amazing and was my favorite item of the desserts.  It was a very moist cake with cream cheese frosting and not too sweet.  It was also HUGE.  It went very well with the spicy pineapple and cold ice cream.  YUM.  I would definitely go there and get just this again.  The creme brulee was pretty standard - it had a great vanilla bean flavor to it.  Unfortunately, I didn't try the shortbread cookie.  The mexican hot chocolate cake was just too chocolately and rich for me, and thus I did not have much.  Definitely, definitely go for the coconut cake when you're there.  5 stars for this.\n\nGreat experience here - would recommend to business travelers and tourists to CLT!", "user_id": "dinZ3pxeWAG9ouMutcH63g", "business_id": "mpDxBBGywUE6GRRKja3sBA"}
{"text": "This place is ok.  It can be crowded (meaning you could be waiting) and the service is not great.  The food was fine, but personally I prefer my soul food to be less upscale (read less overpriced). Frankie's used to be my favortie Italian food in town, but I haven't been very satisfied with my last 2 visits.  The food that used to be so delicious was mediochre and barely food.  The food was oily and just plain ok.  Also i think our waiter was on math or something, either that or he was just really out of it.  Everything about this place lately has just been average- go to Porofino for better prices and better food. this place is fun because it is on the light rail line.   things here do tend to be expensive, but i will say the sushi is yummy and normally priced.  the tizerts cakes are so delish i would eat them until i died. This place was really nice, for the money it should be.  I had a good time, but I don't feel like it was a 5-star experience.  I guess you could say i just wasn't blown away.  But all the food I ate was great- I have a feeling the fact that someone else in my party was allowed to choose our appetizers and dessert may have dimmed the experience slightly.  I really wanted that trio of custards! This is a good little place to get a cheap, greasy meal.  Art's is open for lunch and breakfast (they open really early and close around 2).  This place is small and can be crowded, and it is very informal.  I don't know much about the lunch foods, but the breakfast is pretty good. I haven't eaten here that many times, but I got take out last weekend and it was awesome.  I got the chicken in lemon sauce with grilled artichokes which came with creamy polenta and a veggie (it happened to be cauliflower on that day)- not only was the food fantastic, but it was enough for me to eat two fulls meals.  I also got the side salad which came with a really great homade sundried tomato dressing (also the salad was under $3 which you don't find anywhere these days).  My boyfriend had the penne with meat sauce which he liked, but his portion was noticably smaller than mine- I think the meat entrees are prob a better deal.  The entire meal came with half a dozen garlic rolls, on the house.  Oh, beware that if you go on the weekends this place is packed- I could barely get to the bar to get my to go order. I ate here recently during lunch and had the lunch buffet.  They had a decent selection, about 8 hot items, as well as some relishes and rice pudding.  There is also plenty of naan available.  I eat here at least a couple times a month.\n\nThe dinner menu is awesome too, I haven't tried anything I didn't like and we even took new comers there for a joint summit between mine and my boyfriend's families and every one was pleased.  I would also say the attire is not dressy, casual is fine. I went to college in New Orleans, and so I think I am fairly qualified to judge cajun food.  That being said, the food here was not all that great.  The fried dishes I tried, including fried green tomatoes and some fried seafood, were delicious and accompanied by great sauces.  The typical Nola food didn't fair as well.  The gumbo was heavy on the tomato, and poorly seasoned, and the red beans and rice was virtually flavor-free.  I enjoyed eating here, but I wouldn't return for cajun food (I would return for the fried food, it was delish).  I might have been more forgiving with the food if it hadn't been so expensive (about $20 per person).  Oh, and the tea was instant or nestea or something.", "user_id": "K5dxGhJ99TmS6La6krwkcg", "business_id": "mpDxBBGywUE6GRRKja3sBA"}
{"text": "This place is delicious. Its not cheap. I can't seem to recall where the owners are from. \n\nLunch time is about the best time to go to this place. The lunch specials are still on the high end, but they don't suffer in quality. Unfortunately, I cannot attest to anything but how delicious the weinerschntizel is. I can't seem to bring my self to try anything else. However, the portions could be a little larger. \n\nIn the evening, they serve soft and warm pretzel rolls with the meal. They are also delicious. This is one of the best German places that I've been to in the US. \n\nThe Oktoberfest is not something to be messed with. They pull off the more traditional approaches. Its a tent, and its well managed. There are complaints about the whole ticket system. But given NC/US's weird alcohol rules, they make it work. This place knows how to please their guests. I ate here with my parents on a gift card I received from work. I had the trout, and my parents both had the pork chop [with a side of mac/cheese] Before the meal we had an cornbread appetizer. \n\nAll of the dishes were well plated. My trout was good, but wasn't great. I was disappointed because the pork chop + mac/cheese was awesome. The pork chop was moist, thick, and just amazing. The mac and cheese was tasty but different. \n\nFor three, app and entries came out to $75. Not bad for a very fancy restaurant. I went here with a social group for drinks/meal on a Thursday evening. We had the upstairs reserved just for us. The atmosphere was comfortable. The downstairs [outside of our group] was dead. The physical layout of this place is impressive. On the outside, it looks like a corner business. But its really a full restaurant with an upstairs area. \n\nAnyways back to the actual experience. They served food upstairs for our group, which was cool, but you had to put your credit card down as a tab. [Not an issue]. The bar selection is ok. The food was ok. \n\nThe issue I have with this place is that when you go to pay out, they give you a post swiped transaction. This is the receipt that shows the total, card transaction details, tip, and total. They did not give a receipt detailing the full itemized service. After requesting the receipt and giving a quick look at it I paid, and put down a tip. \n\nAfter looking at the receipt later, it turns out that there was a gratuity charge already added to the receipt. I find this to be very deceptive and FRAUDULENT. Adding grautity to a bill doesn't bother me. It bothers me when 1. it was never stated that would be there, 2. when you don't have sitdown service with a waiter [the social group I was with was more of freeflowing in the bar area] \n\nTo add insult to injury, they try to play the club vibe outside. They put up velvet ropes, and use a door man. There was no line, and secondly, giving an impression of an \"exclusive club\" is a joke when there is only a handful of people at the bar downstairs. \n\nVibe: Dead\nFood: Decent\nDrinks: Typical selection\nDrink price: $5 for a beer. [Mid range for downtown]\n\nWould I go here again? No. Absolutely not.\n\nI've been to the ballantyne location twice, and I can't say that's a bad place. This place is different. Its not the best food I've had in the world, nor is it the worst. I had the creole. It wasn't bad, but the only option to give the meal a kick of spice was texas pete or their own special jalapeno sauce. The service didn't exist, as that I ate at the bar. \n\nThe parking is badly setup. The parking lot is small, and forces people to park at other businesses or on the side of the street.", "user_id": "ynXZtAIgAPzpLoHzY-DJvg", "business_id": "2_0P2AmSSFtPgddio0MgYA"}

Ho Ho Cherry House. \n\nIt's Wednesday night; I'm supposed to be meeting a coworker for trivia at some dive-bar in Ballantyne, but it's that sort of awkward cold outside where it's too chilly for shorts but not quite cool enough for long pants. Plus, I don't have any clean socks. So I blow it off and call Ho Ho Cherry House. \n\nIt's Thursday night; my ladyfriend and I have a hundred bucks worth of unassembled Galaxy Squad LEGO kits stacked up on the coffee table and the latest Channing Tatum action flick pirate-bay'd. Who do we call? Ho Ho Cherry House. \n\nIt's Friday night; I'm supposed to be meeting up with my friends to hang out around a fire pit and drink beer and talk about life, but I'm \"feeling kind of sick\" or \"I'm really busy\" or \"Really? I didn't get that text\". Instead, I'm calling Ho Ho Cherry House. \n\nIt's Saturday night. AJ and S are coming over to drink gin and play old school Mario with the lady and me. We wanna grub up but AJ and I are unsuccessful in convincing the women to cook us something. So we call Ho Ho Cherry House. \n\nIt's Sunday evening; the Panthers are playing a late-game at San Francisco. I have a free-pizza coupon from Papa Johns stuck to the front of the fridge.

It's ALL GOOD. \n\nSeriously, if you're in their delivery radius (from 7th street), hit this place up. It's very consistently good, the delivery drivers are friendly and professional, and their website has super-convenient online ordering so that you can get through 90% of the experience without having to speak to another human. \n\nOn those nights where you just wanna stay in, be lazy, and gorge yourself on something cheap, delicious, and oh-so-not-good for you, Ho Ho Cherry House is it. \n\nLet me emphasize one thing: The name of this restaurant is HO. HO. CHERRY. HOUSE. An inspiring entrepreneur selected for the name of his or her establishment, Ho Ho Cherry House. This is a real thing that is happening around us that we can all be a part of. No joke. \n\nIt's Chinese takeout that tastes like Chinese takeout. It's predictably, unspectacularly exactly what it's supposed to be. \n\nVery few things in life infuse me with as much pure joy and anticipation as someone uttering the words...\n\nHo. \nHo.\nCherry.\nHouuuuuuussssseeeeee. It was one of those unanticipated nights, where a coming together of long unseen friends and everyday acquaintances coalesces into something magical. It was supposed to be a mens night for the men and a ladies night for the ladies, but before we could go our separate ways the men realized they loved the ladies and the ladies too loved their men and so all together we decided not to deny ourselves the company of the other sex. Unanimously, we wanted Cajun Queen.\nWe were all already lit up from our daylight binging, so by the time we stumbled in we were ready for a good time. A milk-skinned hostess in a golf-green blazer and a white and peach paisley blouse batted at us with hazel eyes beneath a mop of perfectly tussled and pasted curls. \"We have eight,\" I said. She glowered. Before she could reply, I little-white-lied her: \"We called ahead... they told us to come right now.\"  \nGreen blazer took off to see what she could manage; we loitered in the foyer, teetering drunk, glazed eyes reeling under the light of the antique chandelier. Green blazer came back and told us it'd be a bit of wait and recommended we hit the upstairs bar. We were already halfway up the steps. \nCajun Queen is one of those big old Elizabeth houses, southern gothic, eclectically arranged and echoing blindly with voices from some other era. It's a chatterbox of ancient heritage and white-hot with flickering, inconsistent lights that make you want to trim your mustache pencil thin and drink only from a snifter. Aroma suffused our consciousness and we all just became mindless, visceral things.\nAt the upstairs bar, this long swan of a bartendress was commanding the room, elegantly and fluidly fetching glasses from the overhead rack, snatching mixers from the under-counter cooler, upturning bottles and dispensing drafts, all motions in succession, all so swift and natural, like something perfectly choreographed and rehearsed. She doled out a trayful of Olde Meck Coppers and we set ourselves to achieving the night.\nWe were led to a corner table near the glassed wall of the little balcony at the back. I took a chair at the end, sat, leaned back, and rapped my knuckles against the abrasive texture of the mud-red stucco. Our very knowledgeable, upright waiter prattled off a series of specials and toppings of the day with juicy detail, but I all heard was 'something unbelievably amazing' followed by 'something else equally amazing'. I requested a couple batches of fried oysters for the table, and then we went in rounds, ordering our blackened catfishes and our crawfish etouffees and our obscene platters of shrimp and fish and sausage and delight.\nWithout needing to ask, our upright waiter returned with another round of beers and a handful of waters. \"Good man,\" I said with an acknowledging nod. Huxley was sitting at the opposite end of the table. We had subconsciously retained the man-woman divide throughout the evening. I looked her way until she felt my gaze and when she glanced back I shot her a clever wink. She smiled. I swooned. \nOur food arrived and we all collectively lost our minds. Remoulade-dipped oysters, creamy clumps of spicy rice, mouth-searing fish and peppery shrimp, beer and wine, more wine, and life and love and faces flush and hearts racing. We ate ourselves full, but couldn't stop. Flavors were assaulting us in such unmitigable ways, we were powerless to refuse their beckoning call of mouth-flaming, heart-swelling, eye-watering release. Ryan, at one point, shoved his seat back, sat up straight with hands on thighs, neck rigid like a scout-dog, let out a billowing exhale, momentarily composed himself, then jumped back in for another oyster and few more forkfuls of rice. \nAt the table behind us, a prim blond let out a squelch of a cry, half-stood, leaned forward, grabbed her man behind his fuzzy dark ears, and kissed him hard on the mouth. She held that embrace for some time, and all the lights and sounds in the room imploded in upon them. When her lips broke free from his, all the noise and clarity rushed back upon us in a crash. She sat down and knuckled a tear from her eye.\n I clapped my hands and beamed across the room. \"This is the greatest night ever!\" I shouted out to the dining area. \nKathryn, a steadying force in our group, narrowed one eye and nodded at me placatively. \"You really enjoy the hyperbole, don't you?\"\n\"Get up for it, Kathryn!\" I threw my hands wildly about in the air above me. \"If it isn't the greatest night... then tell yourself it is, believe it, and make everyone else believe it too! Then it really will be!\"\nThe prim blond and her man giggled, and a few tables around us applauded. I ceremoniously forked the last fried oyster from our appetizer tray, held it high like a chalice, like a triumph, angled my neck, opened my jaw wide, and brought it down mightily into my mouth.\nKathryn looked around, a touch embarrassed, and then began furiously laughing. \"Oh, I believe it,\" she said. \"I believe it.\"", "user_id": "GRiX5F5zgJiQQ1NyV3B6Cg", "business_id": "cibtubYc6gd8T6Y-nPPByw"}
{"text": "Eh.. \n\nI had the chicken alfredo; the noodles were hard, the sauce was thin.  Boyfriend had steak au poivre, which turned out to be brown gravy dumped over the steak. Interestingly, the steak was actually really good. and the gravy was good too but brown gravy over steak does not make it steak au poivre. \n\nNot their fault, but their credit card machines were down for like an hour... they did comp us drinks while we waited though. So, let's make that a 2.5 stars. I went to Mimosa Grill for the first time last week, during lunch. Because it is located in the Wells Fargo atrium, it is advisable to make reservations for lunch during the week, because it can be quite busy! The interior is beautiful and relaxed chic. I had the hickory grilled steak and parmesan frites. I didn't care for the mimosa steak sauce that came with it, but I never use steak sauce, so take that for what it's worth (served on the side). The flank steak was served sliced and cooked as I had requested, and was topped with a gravy/sauce of some kind that was phenomenal. The frites were good too. My dining partner had the trout, which he had on a prior visit and was pleased as well. Our server was attentive but not intrusive, the manager came over to check up on us; the service was above par. For dessert I had the chocolate ganache cake and my lunch partner had the chocolate bread pudding. \n\nIt is important to note the prices are on the higher side for lunch; with most running between $13 and $15. i have been to blue about 4 times, i think, and i've never been disappointed. everything i've eaten here has been wonderful. hummus: delicious. red peppers stuffed with goat cheese: to die for. filet a la blue: done gone to heaven. \n\ni recently came here with a big party and we had a little room off to the side which was just us after the other tables finished up. every person there was pleased with their meals and almost everyone ordered something different. to start we got a couple of appetizer trays. we had calamari, arancini di riso (risotto balls), maybe some kind of fried ravioli or something else? i'm not sure. we had a lot of food. one person ordered the moroccan chicken, another the salmon, another the duo of wild boar, two of us had filet a la blue, there was another steak and another fish too. everything was perfectly presented. the waiter was friendly but not intrusive. he even hooked us up with a special event dessert platter. pumpkin cheesecake, lava cake, and something else. \n\nmy only complaint this time around was my \"extra dirty\" martini was not really dirty at all. but they did me a solid and sent out a cup of olive juice so i could make it as dirty as i pleased. :) can't wait to go back again! now, that's what i'm talkin' about! \ndefinitely one of the first meals i had after moving to the QC. a little on the expensive side, but worth it. \nit's in this cute house, with a small parking lot in the back. you can't miss it because there's a GIANT GATOR out front. \ni started off with the bbq shrimp app-- oh, man! soooo spicy my nose ran, i love it! i had the red beans and rice with andouille (both sides) as my entree (kind of like a create your own meal :) ) the shrimps were so spicy the red beans and rice cooled me down. \ncan't wait to go back!", "user_id": "8GHGLm2uZN4S0sVCXMxP2g", "business_id": "9fxTX1uyyYF4ugx68AG2sg"}
{"text": "Best cornbread I have ever had.\n\nA little out of the way for someone that doesn't live or work in uptown, but trust me, it's worth the trip for the cornbread alone.\n \nI got the creole which was pretty good and authentic. Big portions that I barely even made a dent into. Honestly though, I couldn't stop thinking about the cornbread throughout the meal.\n\nThe interior is somewhat basic. It's a casual mom and pop atmosphere and you almost forget that your just steps outside of a bustling downtown area.\n\nAfter a great first experience with the creole, I'm excited to return and try the fried chicken \"meat and three,\" which is what they seem to really be famous for.\n\nDid I mention I loved the cornbread? Came here with the boyfriend and his parents who had a gift certificate for dinner on a Saturday night. There was a high school jazz band raising money for a cancer patient, which included a silent auction. We spoke with the student who had organized the event (a cancer survivor) and were immediately touched by his words and the effort he put into a wonderful event. It makes me extremely happy knowing Blue welcomed the group to put this on. \n\nThe ambience is upscale, sophisticated and cosmopolitan. Dress is formal. It was a very busy night given the jazz fundraiser but luckily we were seated further away from the band.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of wine from the menu, the waiter admitted he didn't know anything about it and sounded confused when we ordered it. A few minutes later we were told that they didn't have it in stock (so why was it on the menu?). He came back out with a different wine that he was offering for a discount and we obliged.\n\nTo be honest with you nothing really jumped off the menu to me. Usually I find myself toying between a few options but there was nothing that really excited me. I settled for the beef tenderloin and fried calamari appetizer.\n\nThe bread (and butter!) was delicious! There were two kinds and I can't remember was in either but they were tremendous. The calamari was so so. The sauce tasted like a ranch aioli out of the jar and was not the lemon-harissa sauce as advertised on the website. Portion was also very small for the price.\n\nThe entrees came out and both myself and another that ordered the beef tenderloin had to send it back. I ordered medium-rare and it was purple, barely cooked in the middle. The best part of the meal was the creamy gorgonzola dolce on top of the cut. The pea risotto that it was served on was unexciting.\n\nOn top of this all one of the raffle items was a bundle of wine valued for about the same as the one bottle that we were presented in place of our original request. A very unprofessional oversight for such a \"sophisticated\" place.\n\nI left wishing that I had ordered the grouper special which received rave reviews from others at the table and I would not come back here without a gift certificate...what a coincidence we left that night with a winning auction for gift certificate to Blue. I guess I'll be returning after all.\n\n Simply put, it is overpriced and not worth your money. VERY rarely do my boyfriend and I leave dinner completely satisfied, elated and already planning our next trip. Well, Cajun Queen happened to be one of those meals.\n\nNeither of us eat cajun/creole very often so we were a little hesitant at first. After holding on to a Groupon for a few weeks we finally made the trip...what on earth took us so long?!\n\nOne step through the doors and you're immediately transported to a raucous, lively setting reminiscent of 1980's New Orleans. Tables are tightly packed; patrons share drinks and laughs; and sounds of jazz echo from upstairs. The walls are adorned by \"Nawlins\" inspired artwork and an appropriate purple, gold and green palette is interwoven throughout the house.\n\nThe Gumbo was the only thing that I wasn't completely impressed with. It had good flavor and an ample helping of shrimp but I felt it was missing something. The consistency was thinner and more watered down than I anticipated. Keep in mind I am no cajun aficionado.\n\nThe boyfriend ordered the pasta special: Two blackened chicken breasts over a heaping portion of tortellini in a spicy pesto cream sauce with peppers, Andouille sausage, peppers, and artichokes. WOWEE MAMA. This was one of the most delicious meals (yes, it wasn't even my meal) that I've had in a while.\n\nMy \u00e9touff\u00e9e was delicious as well, thought admittedly, not quite as impressive as the pasta dish. It did kick some heat but it was good flavorful spice heat. Large portions seemed to be the theme of night and despite force-feeding ourselves to the point of pain, we both managed to leave with decent-sized leftovers.\n\nFrom the camaraderie and excellent service to the food and drinks...everything seemed to be perfect and I cannot wait to return!", "user_id": "6uDXOqTEwYZYGjCT4JRuAA", "business_id": "mpDxBBGywUE6GRRKja3sBA"}
