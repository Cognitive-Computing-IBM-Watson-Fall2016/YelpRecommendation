{"text": "I like to eat here because the food has always been good and kids eat free on the weekends which is great. But this location is always woefully understaffed, with five or six tables sitting unbussed while people wait to be seated. Whether you're inside or at the drive through the wait is incredibly long. Fortunately the staff are always friendly despite the ridiculous staffing levels the management maintains here. Ugh. I've always been an Eat n Park fan, but this place was awful. It was a Friday night and granted it was pretty busy, but gawwwwwd. It seemed like every single employee was around 16 years old. The service was very slow. We ordered an appetizer platter and cheese fries to split. Easy enough, right? Well they didn't fry anything long enough so it was soggy and all the breading was falling off everything. My drink was never refilled. Even worse, we noticed ants crawling all over the window sill next to us!\n\nHalf an hour later the server decides to ask \"You gettin' dessert?\" We ordered slices of pie to go. My \"slice\" of strawberry pie was two strawberries and a few crumbs of crust. We went up front to pay to find one lady at the register (who seemed to be the sole adult employee) counting her drawer and nobody else in sight. We stood there and evil eyed her for a few minutes and she finally took a break from her conversation to say someone would be with us. A few more minutes and finally the girl who was our server rings us up. I asked for a different, ACTUAL slice of pie, which she managed to get about five minutes later. Basically the whole experience was pure torture, which is disappointing. I really wasn't thrilled with our meal here. The service was fine, although a bit slow for a not-so-busy Wednesday night. We started with the breaded zucchini, which was about 90% breading, 10% zucchini. The breading was much too heavy and you could barely taste the vegetable.\n\nI had the parmesan crusted chicken with pasta, which seemed to be coated in the same breading they used on the zucchini, still too heavy and altogether flavorless. The chicken was cooked perfectly though, it just needed some spices and salt and pepper for goodness sake. The pasta was cooked well and the sauce was fine though. My husband was not thrilled with his pasta primavera, which was, strangely enough, very spicy (though the server did warn us about this beforehand, to her credit) and again, not much flavor and many of the veggies not cooked thoroughly. Sometimes the service here is hit or miss...they can get pretty busy. It can also get pretty crowded. But the food is good and the atmosphere is fun and laid back. And can you beat a room filled with beer? Can you beat mix and match six packs? Nope. 35 cent wing night, yum. Crazy deep fried, bacon covered hot dogs, yum.\n\nI will say though that I could not go here while I was pregnant...you can smell the delicious beer in the air and the Beer Cave taunted me mercilessly with that which I could not indulge...sigh. That was a tough nine months.\n\nThings I don't like so much...tables too close together and too small. The macaroni and cheese is bland, although you can't ask much for two bucks. There is nothing on their website right now other than the menu. Servers can be a bit brusque or forgetful and not refill your drinks without asking, but it kind of goes with the atmosphere I suppose.\n\nAll in all as a Regent Square resident this is our go-to place to hang out and bring friends and visitors.", "user_id": "6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA", "business_id": "6ilJq_05xRgek_8qUp36-g"}
{"text": "Frankfurters has only been open a few weeks, but it already has the feel of a hangout, the staff is welcoming and friendly - you'll find yourself chatting with other diners before you know it. The menu is simple and it's clear they care about flavor - you'll get asked whether you want your buns toasted, which to me is the key to a good sandwich anywhere. We had the Chicago-style (tons of veggies and peppers, \"dragged through the garden\"), and the Chef with kraut and mustard, along with a small order or fries, definitely large enough for two people.  The fries had some skin on, which I really liked. Part of me wished the dogs were bigger, but the prices are so good you should just order two if you're hungry. I'll be back! You know what's good? Tomato-basil soup with cream in it.  And even better? Finding a way to eat on the patio in January. Where the dining room at Casbah is intimate and warm, the patio is bright, open and shielded from the elements. The waitstaff was friendly and helpful, and the lunch specials were actually special - good flavor, slightly indulgent, but you don't leave feeling overstuffed. I want to eat my way through the menu. I've eaten at Casbah four times since my first review - from cocktails and an appetizer to lunch, everything has exceeded my expectations and the service has been great every time: polite, helpful recommendations, and my glass is never empty. I continue to think that the Piccola Gusta lunch menu is a real value and has some really delicious options, but I would have dinner just to try those little candies they offer at the end of meal at dinnertime again - they are a cross between maple sugar and caramel, so good they're worth a star all by themselves. The food is simply four-star good, but the atmosphere and service are definitely worth a star all by themselves. Max's is cozy in a neighborhood hangout kind of way, with a menu that will hit the spot if \"nouvelle\" is not your favorite cuisine.  They do have a vegetarian sandwich, but we went for the potato pancake reubens (turkey and regular) with onion rings and apple sauce and were very pleased.  The pancake batter is on the floury side, so they are more pancake than latke, but they were good nonetheless.  \n\nIf I lived a little closer, I'd be here all the time - local North Side brews, and a menu I'm looking forward to exploring from top to bottom. They even have my favorite dessert from when I was little, Black Forest cake, so you know I'll be back for that. D's looks unassuming, but it's really over the top. Sure, they have fries, but why not order fries with bacon and cheese on them, plus ranch dressing on the side (You should, by the way - those are the pub fries and they are delicious). You could order a plain hot dog, but why do that when you have a choice of five different kinds of frank, and toppings like the Chihuahua: avocado, salsa, cheese and jalapeno? Plus, your dog (even if it's a turkey dog like mine) might arrive at the table with a little char on it; that to me is the peak of hot dog flavor.\n\nI feel like a restaurant that serves cheese sauce like a food group should have a warning label on the door, but with their sense of humor, the label would say \"Warning: the food inside is damn delicious and best consumed with a great beer.\"", "user_id": "zYdFH6R1fKGJWgqcYEg5bw", "business_id": "fJjBMRGnkzc7nVm6VqxoxQ"}
{"text": "My boyfriend took me to Casbah for my birthday this March. This is one of our twice-a-year splurges and I have been wanted to go to this restaurant for ages.\nWe were seated outside, in the covered, heated patio. We were far enough away from the heaters that we didn't get too hot, and far enough from the doors that we didn't get too cold. The menu has changed slightly since we dined there, but some of the things have stayed the same.\nWe started with the sheep's milk gnudi, which is like ravioli without the pasta. I have a gluten allergy and I have missed ravioli quite a bit, so I was happy to eat this. The flavor of the sheep's milk is quite strong and unique, which I like. \nFor entree, I had the double-cut pork chop. This was absolutely great - the flavors and textures of the pork, butternut squash risotto, braised kale, garlic cream, and sage jus went really well together. It was an enormous portion, as well - I took some home and ate it the next day!\nMy boyfriend had the seared rare tuna. He was less thrilled with his dish, and when I tasted it, I agreed. I normally LOVE seared tuna but this was not the best treatment of it. It tasted a little too \"fishy\" and I didn't think the other flavors complimented the tuna. \nInstead of dessert, we sampled two dessert wines recommended to us by the server. I do think that $10 is a little much to charge for such a small glass of wine, but I guess that's what you have to expect when you dine at this level.\nWe are great fans of the Big Burrito restaurants, and I think we preferred our experience at Soba to Casbah. While our food was really good, the prices were a little unreasonably high. And I wouldn't recommend the seared tuna! UPDATE: July 2013\n\nWent back for a visit to the alma mater and decided to stop in at D's before heading out. I have updates on the gluten-free beer situation and the nacho situation.\n\nGF Beer: MUCH improved from what I remember. They had at least three varieties of the \"deglutenized\" beers - Estrella Damm Daura and both the Amber and Blonde Brunehaut (from Belgium!). They MAY have had Omission as well. \nThey also have at least three varieties of New Planet, and at least two of Greens. Dogfish Head T'weasonale. Possibly New Grist and Tread Lightly? I was in a haze of deliciously non-gluteny beer at this point. \n\nNachos: Maybe I'm recalling incorrectly, but I think when I've had these in the past they are made with real cheese - you know, shredded and melted. This time they were served with that nasty-ass liquid cheese goop, like you get at a ballpark. Blegh. \n\nStill four stars overall! Avoid the nachos though.\n\n---\n\nThe only food I've ever had here is nachos, so I can't speak to that. I WILL speak to the beer selection, though! I've managed to collect quite an assortment of beer snob friends, who love spending hours (literally) in the Cave o' Beer. I have to eat gluten free, so most ordinary beers are off-limits for me, BUT, they have an enormous selection of hard cider! Many many different kinds, including my favorite cider in the whole world, JK Scrumpy. Totally reasonable prices, too.\n\nNow the bad:\n1. They close at midnight! After the downstairs closes you can take your drink upstairs to a little bar, but it's super loud, has no seating, and you don't have access to the magical treasure trove of beer. Boooo.\n2. This is totally a niche thing, but I wish they had a better selection of gluten-free beers. There are lots of tasty ones out there, but they often only have Bards and Redbridge.", "user_id": "DcQobAk5lNJw6pVI4nVN1Q", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}
{"text": "I'll be honest, this wasn't our first, second or even third option for breakfast, but when it came to early Sunday grubbing with a group of six, this was pretty much the only place didn't have a two-day long wait. \n\nIn fact, there was no wait at all when the six of us popped in a little after noon on the weekend. Odd, but my group was hungry so we didn't question the kismet. \n\nThe restaurant is pretty enormous as far as cafes go, and it's nice because they don't pack the tables on top of each other so you're never going to be crammed next to a crying baby or having to scoot your chair in every time the table next to you needs a coffee refill. The furnishings all appear to be second hand finds as well as local art and LOTS of owl statues. It's a hoot, for sure. \n\nOne weird thing is the one bathroom with the sink outside, so if you're sitting in the back you can heavily monitor who comes out and doesn't wash their poopy hands. On the other hand, if you go to the bathroom here you'll likely feel like you have to make your hand washing some sort of big production so the other people in the back will take notice of your exceptional hygiene habits.\n\nI was feeling pretty sick still and actually brain washed myself  into believing that my weekend bug was actually morning sickness so on top of already feeling super nauseous and not hungry, and naturally my non-motherly instincts wanted to starve whatever demon might be brewing inside me but the hypothetical baby's daddy insisted I eat something and took it upon himself to order me the tofu scramble, which I was sort of excited to try despite feeling otherwise very green. It was actually very bland and dry and even though I think it was only like $3, I think I would have rather had the $3 in my pocket than the scramble so I took a few bites and then pawned it off on the boo who insisted I try his veggie breakfast burrito. The burrito was the total opposite of the scramble- absolutely outstanding and even though it was the size of a guinea pig, I think I could have downed the whole thing (of course, I would have blamed it on my imaginary incubating child and said I was eating for two). \n\nGoing around the table, everyone seemed content with their food, besides the grits order that were decidedly bland, but that's kind of how I've come to think of grits in general. Our service was great and though most of the table's food was just okay, that burrito, the owl statues and the house horchata I ordered as my beverage really made the experience for me. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I can understand the 3-star average on Yelp, but that I think you can totally come here and have a 4 or even 5 star time if you order wisely. Just remember: Burrito, horchata and time the bathroom-goers for extra entertainment. \n\nPS- I'm so NOT pregnant (in fact, can someone get me a heat pack a few dozen Midol?), but thanks for your concern. If you're like me, you probably enjoy watching people eat hot dogs and will want to make D's a destination when hanging in the 'burgh. \n\nWhat? I can't be the only one. Seriously? Fine. Then excuuuUUUuuuse me. I'll rephrase for the supposed masses.\n\nIf you enjoy eating hot dogs, you'll want to make D's a destination when hanging in the 'burgh. It's a great place to go and get some tubed meat in a variety of different mix and match combinations and also a great place to meet new people... perhaps you'll even meet someone who shares your love of you eating hot dogs and you can shower them with many moments of which they can watch you eat your beloved wieners and y'all can live happily ever after. \n\nNo? Ugh, fine. Then just eat the damn hot dog all by your lonesome. See if I care.\n\nI came in with a group of friends for a semi-liquid lunch and though it was the beer cave that brought us in, I was secretly more excited about watching my friends eat hot dogs. You see, I'd been feeling super sick for the entire duration on my Pittsburgh road trip. I think it was a bad Cholera strain. Anyway, my party of six allowed me to sleep in extra late while they wandered around some graveyard by our hotel with scones until I was all puked out and ready see what the light of day looks like. I was feeling bummed that I had to hibernate through my original morning plan of going to the zoo, but the thought getting to see my pals suck down chili dogs all Jack & Diane style really helped lift my spirits.\n\nWe walked in, sat down and I was immediately excited to be sitting across from their epic celebrity mural. It's like a pop-culture/history 'Where's Waldo', only there's no Waldo, and instead Gandalf, Wolverine, John Candy, and more. I spent the entire time between ordering and the food coming out staring at the wall and finding new peeps. My only gripe on the artwork is that the mural was seriously lacking in Bill Murray biz-nasty, so for that I have to subtract a star. Okay, no. I'm only (half) joking about the star thing. I'm actually deducting the star because their veggie dog was pretty damn terrible. I mean, the toppings (I got the chihuahua with cheese and jalapenos) were fine, but I think I've microwaved dogs that tasted better than theirs. It was so freaking rubbery and tough and chewy... like bad calamari or trying to chew a whole pack of rock hard Bazooka Joe at once. My jaw was tired from trying to force my tearing teeth into that little soy sausage but the worst part is that I had to devote so much extra time to eating my stupid wiener that I missed being able to watch my friends eat their hot dogs. Boo-urns. Next time, I'll skip the veggie dog and go with a wrap or pizza or burger or something that'll allow for more wiener-peeping.\n\nOn the other hand, the veggie pub fries were damn good and something I resented having to offer to share them with my friends... but I did offer because I felt like it would detract from them getting 'weirded out' at my wanting to gawk at them like I bought a ticket to watch them eat hot dogs... even though that wishful thought didn't pan out anyway thanks to the lackluster veg-dog I ended up with. \n\nTheir beer selection was stellar and their beer cave in back was a fun shopping experience and great place to find a few rarities. They actually had the Rogue Voodoo Doughnut bombers that you can hardly ever find. Unfortunately, my sickness impaired me from imbibing and I actually spent the latter half of the time there barfing in the bathroom (not to the fault of D's) while my friends shopped for a bevy of beer in the cave. Also worth mentioning is how friendly everyone here was. Lots of helpful staff members and even the other ladies in the bathroom who were concerned with my hurling to the point where they wouldn't leave me alone and I had to lie and say that it was no big deal, I was in my first trimester and the morning sickness was getting the best of me.

{"text": "I have been wanting to try this place for so long as a huge Big Burrito fan.  We finally made it for Sunday brunch and happy to report it lived  up to my expectations.  We sat in the outside area (covered but with heating lamps) and had a great waiter.  They have a price fix brunch with includes a drink, app and entr\u00e9e.  We decided to just order entrees and glad we did as the entrees are very large portions. I went with the mushroom and goat cheese omelet but substituted the mushrooms with tomatoes. It also came with toast ( I went with wheat), fingerling potatoes, and choice of a meat-I got the bacon. The omelet was delicious and the bacon was crisp just the way I like it.  We did have to wait a while to get salt & pepper, ketchup and jelly but finally got it all before our food got cold.   Others in my party got the eggs benedicts, shrimp omelet with egg whites and waffles. Everything got good reviews. What I also loved was we got a big pastry basket with biscuits, apple cinnamon muffins and scones.  Al very tasty and a nice starter.  I would really like to go back for happy hour as they have a very nice bar inside. There are not many options for good dining on the North Shore and by process of elimination this is where we ended up during a Pirates game.  We were seated pretty quickly and they have options for indoor and outdoor dining. It was opening day and quite crowded but our server did a nice job. I started off with a Corona. My big disappointment was they had a special game day menu and it was very limited with not many options.  I went with the cobb salad and it was very good-fresh veggies and a nice portion size.  I do think that the prices are a little high. This is some of the best pizza in the Burgh! Glad they added more seating and did some renovations. This place is usually pretty busy, the food is great at the right price. Two slices of their square cut pizza is enough for me and at a $1.40 a slice you cannot go wrong. The shredded cheese on top is truly for the cheese lovers like me. You can ask them to melt the cheese on top but I like it just as is. If you choose to add toppings they give you plenty and charge about 50 cents def worth it. They also serve hoagies and sandwiches which I would love to try but the pizza is too darn good not to get. Great place to have a party!  Bado's is located in a cute section of Mount Lebanon with street parking or a metered parking lot in the back (it was only $5 for a 24 hour period).  Our friends rented out the top part of the restaurant for a 30th birthday party. This was a large space which could easily fit over 50 people comfortably.  There was a small bar with 3 draft beers to choose from, tables set up for food and tables to sit at.  We were served their huge pepperoni pizza which was very tasty!  The sauce was sweet and a thin crust.  Downstairs they had a nice selection of draft beers to choose from.  They also have a rooftop section! This is a beer lover's dream and one of my favorite spots in Regent Square.  Great place to go to watch a game.  It is also kid friendly as almost every time I am visiting this place there are families with young children enjoying themselves.  The biggest decision is to pick a beer off the draft list which always has a great selection or pick one from in the beer cave. I usually try a draft and then head into the chilled beer cave. There is also a larger section of single beers for purchase in the back that are not cold. If you want to drink them while at the restaurant they have a chiller-so cool!!  My past visit I was impressed by the large selection of pumpkin beers. I tried a bottle called Baked by Lancaster Brewing-tastes just like pumpkin pie!!  To go with it I ventured from my usual Chicago dog and ordered the Angry Tikki-pineapple, bacon and special cheesy, sweet and spicy combo mixture of sauce. I was not disappointed and a great choice. The poppy seed buns they serve the dogs on are the best!", "user_id": "wCJbSEmMeZ0mAnJRQEyfCQ", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}
{"text": "I'm pretty much committed to trying EVERY BYOB restaurant around so this was on my list for a long time. Friends told me it wasn't worth it but I persisted to the point that we went there for lunch yesterday. My first reaction was not a pleasant one. The cheap plastic chairs, the small close together tables, the tacky decorations, not a good feel but I pressed on. \n\nNow, I didn't avail myself of the BYOB (might have resulted in a higher rating!!) and it was only lunch so I can't comment on dinner. Regrettably, I won't ever try them for dinner so this is the best I can offer.  I think Legends in their name only applies to the sports heroes and not any legendary food experience you'll find here. \n\nThe place is essentially a diner. Diner atmosphere, diner chairs, diner specials, diner everything. Not that I don't appreciate diners, I do. But this atmosphere is BLAH.  I'd rate it a max of 2 stars. Max. \n\nFood on the other hand is ok. Not great. Ok. Worth going out of your way for? Absolutely not. I had the Parma hot sausage with a bowl of black bean soup- both things I love!!! We're these memorable? Not in the least. It's generous to say they were adequate. \"Mama's gravy\", a marinara sauce of sorts, was lackluster and flavorless. The sausage was just a split link of hot sausage and something I could replicate at home with ease. The black bean soup was listless and uninspired. Sad because i was expecting (hoping?) for so much more.  I wish I had ordered the chicken parm that the guys pressing up against me from behind ordered. It looked way better. But I'll not have that chance cause I won't be going back. I'll drive by this place a thousand times to go to other more deserving places on the Northside. \n\nSorry. Didn't do it for me.  Can't even imagine coming here for dinner with a bottle of wine. Would be awful.  I wanted to give it 2 stars but felt a little generous today. Plus, I thought if I worked down the block, I'd probably come here for lunch. But never would I go out of my way to go here. Surely you've read enough reviews to know you HAVE to go to the Dor Stop. Have to. No matter where you are or how far of a drive it is, do it. Oh sure, you're a Pamela's fan or DeLuca's and swear there can't be anything better around. Oh, my friend, don't be deceived. I too am a fan of those places. Love them. BUT, get your butt to the Dor Stop!!! You will open a new frontier in breakfast possibilities that will have your taste buds shouting hallelujah!\n\nOh my! The banana chocolate chip pancakes are to die for. And the oatmeal raisin ones? You won't believe something that is that \"good\" for you tastes like that!! And the raspberry French toast? Amazing - but only if you can afford the calories! But do it at least once! And their egg scrambles with your choice of ingredients? This is breakfast nirvana. None better in the city. None. This really is a great place. It's hard to find fault with anything here! Great owner, superb bar food, and oh, the huge selection of craft beer. And I'm not talking about the massive collection in the beer cave!! The commitment to have 5 or 6 local brews (Helltown included) on tap in a rotating  \"local\" draft corner is music to my ears. Had Helltown's Reaper Harvest Ale last night and it was fabulous. I've had quite a few local brews here as well as a selection of other crafts. I love having exciting draft beer choices!\n\nThe food is really good too! Wings, dogs, veggie dogs...these aren't just your typical ballpark quality dogs. Nah, these are amazing. The buns, the all beef dog with that welcome \"snap\" when you bite it...yum. Plus the selection of options will keep you coming back to try more and more. The daily specials are worth watching - the 10 wings for $5 on Monday is a bargain!!\n\nSince they don't serve cheapo food or beer, the price reflects that. 2 draft beers and 2 hotdogs  is close to $25. But hey, enjoy it. The crowd is cool, the atmosphere is terrific, and the beer selection is among the best in the city. I'll keep coming back.

{"text": "I am normally a Bar Louie Fan - my husband and I LOVE the one in Tampa.  This location needs a lot of work.  We went on a Friday evening before a show at the Improv.  We were looking to meet up with friends and have drinks and a quick bite to eat.  We never got to the food part because of the level of service that we received.  We got there at about 6:40/6:45 so Happy Hour was wrapping up, but I would say that the bar was not even 3/4 full.  There were also plenty of empty tables.  This should have been our sign to run in the opposite direction.  But we grabbed a table.  I am not a clock watcher, so I am not sure how long it took us to get a server but it was at least 5-7 minutes.  Then we got our drinks at 7:04.  The only reason that I know is because I was looking at my phone because my husband and I wanted to get some apps ordered before the end of Happy Hour.  That went out the window.  When our friends for there; they ordered drinks.  We finished them and left.  The server was nice, that is not the issue.  The issue was how GROSSLY UNDERSTAFFED they were.  They had two bartenders on (I think) and not nearly enough cocktail servers.  The server apologized for the wait on the drinks, but explained it away with \"this happens at the end of happy hour because the bar get swamped\".  That is a sign that you need more staff.  I have never had this happen at any other bar before.  Get more staff.  We ended up passing up on food because we were worried about time, not the fact that we did not get HH pricing.  Even though, in my opinion, they should have honored HH pricing since we were ready to order food at 7:50/7:55.  We ended up going to the Improv and got food there.  Bar Louie lost a great deal of my money because their lack of staffing and they will never get our Pittsburgh business again or our friends who live there. Now that we do not live in Pittsburgh; D's is a must go to when we are back in town.  Their main specialty is beer and that is what I always have so I can not speak to any liquor or wine options.  The beer selection is awesome.  They have over 1000 different kinds of beer.  You just have to make your selection and they will open it for you at your table.  You can also create your own mix and match 6 pack to carry out.  \nNow on to the food.  If you get french fries - I am warning you, the portion is very large.  The ones with bacon and cheese are a great.  We tried both the wet and dry wings and were happy with both.  Now the reason we came here; the hot dogs.  And oh are they amazing.   They have hot dogs combinations on the menu, but you can also create any combination that you want.  I am a HUGE fan of the Chicago Dog - they do it right!!!  \nOn a side note - if you like Root Beer, they have a great root beer on draft.  They do offer a children's menu as well and it is completely fine for children in the middle of the day.  You see tons of families.  \nThe staff has always been very friendly and helpful.  They know their beer and food very well!\nIf you have never been here; I recommend it.", "user_id": "Br0hRNDvFXLz4AM51GwmMw", "business_id": "EoAY1JSVeJriBzId8lUQwQ"}
{"text": "This is a little Hong Kong restaurant gem in Shadyside.But first a disclaimer, if your idea of classic Chinese food runs to General Tso or Kung Pau chicken, chow mein, egg rolls or (perish the thought ) crab Rangoon then this place is really not for you Although much of the business this place does is takeout/ delivery of the type of American Chinese dishes I mentioned above the Forte of Tasty Chinese restaurant is real Hong Kong style food . Unfortunately a great deal of what is on their regular menu and with the delivery services is comprised of the American version  of Chinese food.The first time I came to this place they only gave me the American iced menu.But having lived in the Bay Area for many years I scoped out the Hong Kong style menu and vowed to order from it the next time I went to Tasty and I did.Now I just  pick up the Hong Kong menu automatically when I come in.Their Hong Kong dishes are some of the best I've had in Pittsburgh.The garlic eggplant in a velvety sauce combines the right hint of spiciness with sweet and virtually melts in your mouth.The salted squid (what's usually known as salt and pepper squid) has a light, crispy coating with a minimum of oil and the texture of the squid is\njust a tiny bit chewy but not too much so.Texture in squid is a daunting thing to get just right.I am a Chow Fun freak anyway  but their shrimp chow fun with egg sauce is the best I've ever tasted with slightly charred noodles fresh dhrimp and a wonderful egg scramble sauce . Recently I had a friend visiting from San Francisco and took him here (kind of a test to see if my view of this place was somehow off) and he raved about everything especially this chow fun dish.To sum up,if you want to experience the best of Tasty please order from the Hong Kong menu.Since. I don't order American Chinese dishes here I can't comment on them but I guess the genius of this place is authentic South Chinese dishes (as evidenced by the Chinese families I've seen eating here) not the usual  pseudo Chinese dishes many people seem to order here.I expect the chef/cook here just doesn't have his heart in Crab Rangoon or chow mein. I needed a quick snack before doing errands and heading home and was in the shopping strip where there is a Trader Joe's near Bakery Square.I am usually an Asian food snob having lived for many years in San Francisco / Bay Area but I thought I'd try some Amerasian food.I ordered moo shoo pork which wasn't bad,just kind of bland and not teeming with pork.That being said the vegetables were cooked well with a nice slightly crisp, not soggy texture. I'd sat if you want quite decent not quite Chinese  food  and quickly China Garden wouldn't be a bad place to stop. OK,  this is a place to get beer and the food is secondary.However service still  matters and the service on my visit today leaves a lot to be desired. First the food. Great Chicago dogs with all the fixings but so so Cuban dog with underwhelming toppings.Perhaps it was because their fryer was out but the toppings on the Cuban dog seemed to be out of a plastic pack from Giant  Eagle.The beer was fine a Belgian ale, probably the best part of my experience. The first server I had did get me a second glass of beer but although I asked for a menu never got back to me to see what I wanted to order.Eventually another server did and I ordered.So if you want a beer definitely come on over and for some of the hot dogs you'll be fine but if you want consistent service forget it\nThis is the ultimate in bro style  service best suited to half loaded  college students or anyone with low expectations of service at a bar and grill.", "user_id": "Gt-LiocbjV7Yo1Uqlsi4Ag", "business_id": "Y2p07YEC8xOsYTHWf0UxiA"}
{"text": "I judge a pizza joint by their cheese pizza and their pepperoni.  While grabbing a brew at Voodoo, my friends and I were feeling a bit hungry.  Thankfully a menu was available and Capri pizza was just across the street. \n\nWe ordered a small cheese pizza to pick up.  I was pleasantly surprised!  The cheese was not greasy, the sauce was flavorful, and the dough was chewy yet crunchy... what more could you ask for?  We were really impressed with the quality cheesy pizza from Capri.\n\nNext time we'll try the pepperoni and post an update.  I see yummy pizza in our future.  If you're grabbing a pint a Voodoo and feel a rumbly in your tumbly, order something cheesy at Capri Pizza in Homestead. Meh is the only thing I leave here feeling.  I ordered the classic burger because nothing on the new menu excited me.  For a side,  I requested the seasonal veggies (trying to be healthier) and was told it's a squash mixture - great I love summer squash!  \n\nI received a poorly seasoned burger. The bun had the most flavor which is a sad statement.  It was topped with an olive and a mini pickle... odd.  My \"squash\" side was lacking squash. Instead all squash was replaced by peppers... which I cannot eat.\n\nOur server was nice.  The beer was simple.  With new breweries and restaurants popping up in and around Homestead, perhaps RB should reconsider their flavors. Boston has Cheers.  Dormont has the Dor-Stop.  \n\nWhen I moved to Dormont a few years ago, I was told about this amazing breakfast place that was featured on the Food Networks show, \"Diners Drive-Ins, & Dives\".  I now know why this place is a Pittsburgh staple - Delicious food, Friendly service, and a Cozy atmosphere.\n\nIf you go on the weekend, you'll typically see a line.  Don't let it turn you away!  It usually moves quick and its worth the wait.  It's a small diner atmosphere, so i wouldn't recommend it for parties larger than 4.  Once you get inside, I assure you that you'll be hooked, too.\n\nI've tried several things on their menu - The breakfast burrito - HUGE and delicious with eggs, potatoes, sausage... The pancakes - dense and hearty!  The French toast - who would have thought cornflakes applied to this would make it even yummier?  And my FAVORITE - Vicki's Jumpot - Everything you could ever want in a breakfast!  Eggs, potatoes, ham, cheese, peppers, onions... and though it comes with Italian toast, I swap it for some of the best marble rye in the area.  Incredibly filling, big portions but little prices and always tasty.\n\nYes, it's got to the point where the hostess knows my name when we enter - \"Ashley, party of 2?\"  That's me!  I look forward to any Sunday I get to dine at the Dor-Stop.  Sometimes you've gotta go where everybody knows your name... Who doesn't love a good hotdog?  Add some ketchup, mustard, relish, onion, peppers, chili, coleslaw...? Mac n cheese...?  Whoa - wait these aren't your ordinary hotdogs!  Well, that's how D's does dogs...\n\nJust your local neighborhood beer cave with an incredible all-beef hotdog... nbd.  But they are a big deal in flavor.  A mural of Pittsburgh heroes graces the wall and a hefty beer list awaits.  Can't find one you like on tap?  Check the cave, but make sure your waiter pops the top for you. Still can't find one you like?  Well then we can no longer be friends...\n\nThe menu has everything from hummus to homemade pizza and it's all delicious.  Today I ordered a chili and cheese dog and another topped with Mac n Cheese.  Both incredibly delicious and filling.  They have their specialty dogs like the Mason Dixon  (dog with chili and coleslaw) or the Chihuahua  (salsa, jalape\u00f1os, and other deliciousness), or you can top it your own special way.  You can't go wrong with these puppies... or doggies... you get the idea.\n\nNext trip I'll be adding Mac n cheese to my chili dog.  Why not combine the two toppings, right?  My mouth will be so very happy.", "user_id": "w16jpVr-b-0gd6YHwnIarg", "business_id": "t_gan0EXAw8csKIeFyazJw"}
{"text": "After doing some chores at The Waterfront, we were hungry and decided to try Mitchell's for dinner. We were seated at a comfortable red booth. The clam chowder was perfect; definitely get it. The mussels were delicious--not as firm as mussels usually are (but in a good way) and bigger than normal. The spicy crispy shrimp surprised me; I didn't think it would be good, but it was. Boyfriend said his lobster bisque was \"funky\" and I agreed that it tasted weird, but it was still edible. \n\nThe calamari, however, was unseasoned. Maybe they forgot to season it that night? I feel like the way it was served to us is not the way they usually serve it. Also, I was disappointed with the small portion of the calamari. For $12, we should be getting way more than we did. \n\nOur server was attentive and noticed that we liked a lot of their appetizers, so she informed us about their happy hour (Monday through Friday 4:30-6:30pm) where their appetizers are at most $7 each! Tempting, especially after our pleasant dinner experience.\n\nTaste | 4\nAtmosphere | 4\nPresentation | 3.5\nService | 4\nOVERALL | 4 A lesser known Whole Foods type of market with its own charm. \n\nThis place is pretty cool. There is so much to see and consider buying and I was intrigued at every corner. Listen to the reviews! Their selection of veggies, meats, fruits, frozen items, nuts and pretty much everything is amazing. You'll have so much fun exploring even if you're not looking to really buy anything. Boyfriend got dried mangoes and almond butter. A bit pricey, but we expected it to be. I got some food from the hot food and salad bars. They are small; you might find something you like. (Their mac n cheese is good!) They also have a juice bar, which I'd love to try next time. \n\nEast End Food Co-Op is an excellent place to do your weekly grocery shopping. You can find everything you need here and more. A little further than most brunch places, but hoped it would be worth it. It was hard to decide what to order here because people have raved about half the items on their menu. Decided to get the stuffed raspberry French toast (which looked really good in photos so I knew I had to get it), sausage patties (you get one meat option with the French toast), and German potato pancakes. To be honest, I didn't think the food was amazing. I did enjoy the raspberry French toast, but like most people have already mentioned, it wasn't exactly stuffed. Sausage patties are a staple brunch meat for me, but these tasted microwaved and like they've been sitting out for a while. The potato pancakes I was pretty excited for, but they didn't taste like the potato pancakes I've had at German restaurants, so it wasn't what I thought it'd be. The French toast alone I would give 4 stars out of 5, but the sides I got bring my taste rating for Dor-Stop down. Although I would consider coming back, I'd definitely order different sides.\n\nTaste | 3\nAtmosphere | 3\nPresentation | 3.5\nService | 3.5\nOVERALL | 3.5 D's has the best wings ever! Boyfriend and I went for dinner on a weeknight. It was loud and crowded as I'm sure it is a lot of the time. There was a bit of a wait (about 15 minutes) before we were seated at a table. We got the garlic butter wings, pub fries, and chose kielbasa for our hot dogs. We LOVED the garlic butter wings. I don't think I've ever had such great wings before. They were crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and had so much flavor. We also really enjoyed the pub fries. The hot dogs, however, were just mediocre. It took them a long time to get our food to us, but they apologized and gave us two free hot dogs cards for next time. Although I can't honestly say that the hot dogs are that amazing here (even with the kielbasa), I'm sure we'll be back for the delicious wings and the fries.\n\nTaste | 4\nAtmosphere | 3\nPresentation | 3\nService | 4\nOVERALL | 4", "user_id": "H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg", "business_id": "usSROUMiAgPcxV3Ym0OxMQ"}
{"text": "I have to be honest, I have heard that this place has great potato pancakes but I couldn't care less. Why? Because I eat the same thing every single time I eat there. I have no time to be bothered by some silly pancake when there is serious business, in the form of eggs benedict, that needs taken care of. The eggs benedict at The Dor-Stop is just the way I like it. I feel like so many breakfast spots serve benedicts of all sorts that are usually quite small, have very little hollandaise and are served with a salad. Maybe I am the odd one out in all of this but I cringe when I see a salad served with breakfast foods. I go out to breakfast to eat unhealthy, artery clogging deliciousness. If I wanted to concern myself with veggies I would stay at home and save my money and eat at home. Anyways, their eggs benedict consists of the diner's ham off the bone, two eggs, mancini's bread and a pool of delicious hollandaise. There is no stinginess when it comes to this meal. Everything is heavy handed. In addition to the huge eggs benedict, there is a beautiful mountain of potatoes that comes with it. Everything about this dish is how it should be. Total perfection.b I am not being hyperbolic when I say that my last experience here was the worst food experience I have ever had.\n\n I have eaten at Bado's before and have had pizza that was pretty tasty. So when my roomate wanted to go there, I was pretty excited. There were 4 of us. Two of us had burgers while the other two ordered wedding soup and shared potato skins. My burger was delicious. It was juicy and smothered in bleu cheese. \n\nWhile my food was really good, there were some issues with the other items ordered. Two of my guests cited that the wedding soup had a metalic taste to it while my other friend with the burger found a hair. Being a hairdresser and understanding that it does happen sometimes, she disregarded it and continued to eat her burger. Unfortunately, the hair did not stop there. Another guest found several hairs in their meal as well. We decided that we should let our waitress know. I stopped the waitress and explained how there was hair in two people's food. The waitress got upset and was very rude (it's not like we accused her of planting the hair herself). On top of this, she mistakenly took my burger and walked away with it, leaving the sullied food on the table. When she came back I told her that my burger was not one of the items with food on it and she instantly became defensive. At this point we asked for a manager (who never came) and insisted our meal get comped. Considering she threw out the only good food that we ordered, we didn't feel like that was asking too much. Luckily the waitress did not put up too much of a fight. \n\nI will never eat at Bado's again. A good cheese burger and a decent pie isn't enough when the staff can't even accept their own (human) mistakes. I have been places where there have been food issues before and I have also worked in a restaurant. I completely understand that mistakes happen. However, the reaction that we received was unacceptable. Hot dogs are so wrong! I see the billboards stating that they are the new cigarettes. But, hey, I smoke too, so I'm not that amazing of a listener! I do try and make sure I eat healthier than my disgusting smoking habit but we stopped into D's on our way back into town and I was still in vacation mode! I ordered a chili dog because I am not insane and their spicy cheese dog! Both were delicious! The spicy cheese dog had pepper cheese and pickled relish on it and I love anything pickled! The chili dog was also really hearty but I did wish there were jalapenos on it. i suppose I could have gotten them and am just lazy. Either way, great food! The only reason why I am not giving it a perfect rating is because the bill was pretty high for hot dogs!", "user_id": "JsKvjx4Qiwvof8RV3luTrw", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw"}
{"text": "The husband and I get so excited each week for grocery shopping because of the co-op. I love it so much.\n\nWe need this place in our lives. It gives us hope and makes us feel like we belong. I have never, in my entire life, eaten better broccoli. I sometimes obsess about this broccoli and go through withdraws when we run out. The beet hummus is to die for and the wraps are incredible. I also like the beauty section and natural makeup and night creams. \n\nYes, some stuff can be pricer that Trader Joes's, like the Amy's frozen pizzas, but it is so worth it becasue you know that the extra $ is going towards a good cause.  We got a membership last year and rarely go anywhere else.  And our dog attacks his bowl when we feed him his food. He won't even go near anything else, which we sometimes have to resort to when he runs out. This place is one of the reasons we decided to move to Regent Square. I am not really a huge hot dog fan, but the BEER CAVE and FRIES keep me coming back (not to mention that it is walking distance from our house). We lived in San Francisco for several years, and this place also reminds us a bit of some of our old haunts in the Mission. :)\n\nIn the summer, they open up the garage style windows, so this is a perfect spot to sit, sip beer (skip the wine though-- its not great) and work on your laptop or newspaper. If you are not into sports and just wanna chill, D's has two sides, so you don't have to feel outnumbered by screaming Steelers fans.  D's always has a nice mix of people as well- from young couples with kids, students, hipsters, to elderly folks. The staff is really nice and friendly and the large mural of local Pittsburgh celebs is pretty neat as well!\n\nYeah, this place is one of the best, laid back spots here.  I am in love with the FRIES! I know I said this once, but they seriously do something very special to them that I cannot figure out. Yes. As the previous folks have said, Dunnings is really nothing special, in terms of what most people percieve as a special dining experience. I beg to differ. I always have great, prompt service and the same window seat every time I come here. Then again, I always come in the middle of the afternoon and only order one drink and the French Onion Soup. However I have had dinner here before.\n\nI like Dunnings because it is not tying to be anything other than an old school, family friendly, bar-restuarant. It is a Regent Square staple, and the folks that come here seem to be staples as well. There is a Cheers vibe (early 80's sitcom\nabout a Boston bar where \"everyone knows your name\") and that seems to fare very well with the local residents. After living in Los Angeles for all of my 20's, I find this kind of environment comforting and  refreshing.\n\nFor the life of me, I cannot remember what I had for dinner here. I guess that may be a testament to the mediocre food.\n\nSo, if you are looking for a low key, mellow, old school (dark wood, framed pictures of landscapes a'la Rembrandt) place to check out, have a casual drink and appetizer, Dunnings is your spot.   I feel bad that the previous folks had crappy service, but if you come here with an open mind and the correct expectations, you will love this place as much as I do.\n\nAlso, it is Regent Theater adjacent, so it is also the perfect spot to have a quick drink/ appetizer before a film.", "user_id": "cMlY-nsvj9DCrv_lLVp5Fg", "business_id": "-iVcmhjfq79QoTWzrb6pKg"}
{"text": "I came here last night to get a few appetizers before a movie, and was hoping to be able to write a review on the food. Unfortunately, I cannot because the service was so bad that I left before I had the chance to order. We found seats at the bar behind the taps. After sitting there for 5 minutes and not being acknowledged, we thought that they might not be able to see us, and so we moved to a different pair of seats in the middle of the bar, grabbing a few menus on the way so we would be ready to order. It was fairly busy, but it is not like there were people standing at the bar trying to get drinks - everyone was seated and I'm sure they face much busier times. We sat in our new seats for almost 15 minutes (I timed it - I am not exaggerating), and were not even acknowledged. You would at least think the bartender would acknowledge us and tell us he would be with us when he could, but despite staring him down almost the whole time, we could not even make eye contact. I hope this is a fluke but will probably not be back to find out. What a great find! I frequent the nearby Bryant street restaurants, but did not even know this place existed until a friend of mine brought took me here today for hot chocolate. I immediately fell in love it. The baristas were very friendly and my hot chocolate was great! There were also some incredibly delicious-looking pastries which I will need to go back soon to try. There was a nice ambience - it was quiet but not uncomfortable so. It would be a great place to study, read, or visit with friends.\n\nYou should expect to wait a few minutes for your drink, but it is well worth it :-) This review is on lunch at Buffalo Blues. I have been here a number of times for dinner and for late-night drinks, and have always thought it was a great place to grab a drink and watch a game, but haven't been overly impressed with the food. That is, until yesterday. I came in for a quick bite to eat and ordered the Hot Veggie sandwich. It was FANTASTIC - the best veggie sandwich I have had here in Pittsburgh. Other than that, service was good and fairly quick. I made have found my new go-to lunch spot! The Quiet Storm was great. I started with the soup of the day which was something along the lines of a carrot pumpkin curry. It had an unexpected texture but I still quite enjoyed it. For my entr\u00e9e I had the Spinach Burger, which was quite filling. It is quite unique and comes with plenty of options for toppings. I couldn't resist putting cheese on the otherwise vegan burger, but still felt very healthy eating such a veggie-filled dinner! Their milkshakes also looked amazing - I would have tried one but I needed something to warm me up instead so I got a latte, which was also very good. One other thing I thought was neat was that the sell mixers and encourage you to bring your own champagne and/or vodka. I haven't seen that before, but it's a great idea!\n\nI was also intrigued by some of the other items on the menu, so I will need to go back to try more. I hate to admit this, but I have been here three times and always order the same thing. I usually like to order new things to see if the quality is consistent, but I love the turkey burger with olives and feta SOOO much, I can't bring myself to do it. (Next time, I promise I'll branch out and will write and update then...) I have tried various starters and sides as well, and have always been impressed.\n\nThe waitstaff is not notably friendly, but is friendly enough. They ask many questions to make sure your order is the way you want it (for example, someone else in my party ordered the fish sandwich and was asked: Broiled/grilled? Tarter/cocktail? Lettuce/onion/tomato? Side dish?). It is nice though because they will bring it out EXACTLY the way you ask for it.\n\nOverall, it's a great spot!", "user_id": "ulik60Aw4MMl3fKi78B_fg", "business_id": "EoAY1JSVeJriBzId8lUQwQ"}
{"text": "Sharia don't like it, and neither does Becky. \n\nBoy and I went to Casbah on a warm Tuesday evening. The restaurant wasn't busy, and we were seated in the inviting outdoor patio. Our waitress was very pleasant and extremely informative about both the drink and food menus. \n\nWe shared a bottle of Mission la Caminade (Malbec, French). This was a very good, medium-bodied wine. \n\nMany yelpers have raved about Casbah's bread and pesto. I don't get it. I've had much better sourdough elsewhere and the pesto wasn't anything to write home about. \n\nI had the asparagus soup with crab for an appetizer.  The soup was served cold and tasted fresh enough, but something was off, and I barely ate half of it. \n\nI ordered the orecchiette pasta as an entree, which was served with grilled chicken and cranberries in a goat cheese cream sauce. I am upset to report that this tasted rather bland. The cranberries were the only spark of flavor in the dish.  Boy ordered the ricotta cavatelli pasta, which was in a marinara sauce with sausage and ricotta. I am sad to report that this too was tasteless. The ricotta was dumped on top and added nothing to the dish. \n\nWe glanced at the dessert menu, after spending so much on food we didn't enjoy, boy and I decided to cross the street for ice cream, instead. \n\nOverall, Casbah has a nice atmosphere and service, but their food quality doesn't match the price tag. Generally, I like D's I. The restaurant itself has a cozy feel to it, and their large beer cave is one of the few places where I can get some of my favorite import beer.  Note, the Czechs make more than just Pilsner Urquell. Je to pravda! Most of the staff are very friendly, and the managers are always quick to help if you need assistance.  \n\nSome of you may get angry with me, but I simply cannot review D's I without comparatively rating it against its sister restaurant, D's II in Monroeville.  And no, I couldn't possibly care less that the latter is in an old Pizza Hut.  That's right, I prefer D's II to D's I. Hear me out.  \n\nFirst of all, D's I' drafts are all about a dollar more expensive than those in the suburbs.  Why the upcharge? \n\nAlso, after being spoiled by the very large menu selection at D's II, I'm always a little disappointed when dining at Regent Square.  No wraps, no steak salad, no variety of sandwiches.  I will say that the food they do serve is good.  I enjoy their pizza and their daily hummus offering.  \n\nD's I has a much smaller draft selection and lacks a full bar.  Fine.  It's a smaller location and it stays true to its original \"beer bar\" theme.  Sometimes, however, I like to mix it up.  And I can do that more easily at the Monroeville location.  Obviously, I's beer cave trumps II's beer... um... outcove? \n\nSo all of that warrants a four-star rating.  Why the three? Like its suburban counterpart, I'm docking a star for closing so early.  Even when there is a crowd, the staff closes at 11:00 (Su-W) or 12:00 (Th-Sat) on the DOT.  That's just not responding to demand!\n\nOverall, I don't dislike D's I.  Quite the contrary.  After all, three stars means \"A-OK.\"  But to me, D's Regent Square doesn't go beyond that. Another place I've been going with my family for years. Triangle Bar has huge (26\") battleship subs for very cheap! \n\nOur favorite is the italian, which is perfectly balanced with salami, ham, cheeses, vegetables, and spices. My father loves the roast beef subs too.\n\nI love that it hasn't changed a bit in the two decades I have been going there. Kind of dirty, barred, on the corner of the street... but excellent food! On game nights you will see a stream of people picking up their subs.\n\nNow you know why.", "user_id": "ObYBbapQShoG4zjDR1gSXw", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}
{"text": "Okay, so hopefully you haven't been enjoying happy hour @ Riley's Pour House before you read this or you might not be able to follow the lilting Irish owners. \n\nTo recap: Murphy's Pour House from 1979-1985. Sullivan's Pour House from 1995-2002. Paddy's Pour House from 2002-2012. And, bagpipe please, Riley's Pour House opens March 1 of 2012. Still with me?\n\nIt's a tiny long bar just like the old Irish pubs. No more smoking allowed. Hurrah!!!  Same lousy service. \n\nMy guess is that the entire place needs (no, strike that .... demands) an automated food/beverage ticketing system. None of the cooks, bartenders, or waitresses know who ordered what nor what ticket belongs to which table. It's actually pretty funny if you're not a) hungry or b) thirsty. \n\nI really really want this place to do better. We need more Irish pubs and local old time watering holes. \n\nGet it together, Murphy's ... er, I mean Sullivan's....er, I mean Paddy's or is it Riley's? ;  ).  Whatever the case, they have cold Guinness. And Irish music.  And fun patrons. Stopped by on a Mon evening after trying to dine at Smoke Taqueria which is closed Mondays. Parking on street in front or behind off Hay St. Super friendly bartender. In warmer months they have huge outdoor area & big screen & upstairs cornhole game area. Okay draft beer selection and big bottle selection. Tried the italian club which was really good - two of us split one. Also tried sweet potato fries - amazingly good! Home made chips w bleu were overpowered by sauce. Bathroom was in need of plaster and wall repairs & was grossed out by toilet brush/holder on a shelf near toilet at eye level. Bet it's a fun place in warmer months. I go here a lot.  I think most folks who live in Regent Square/Swissvale/Edgewood area do too.  And it's probably not because the food is so utterly delicious.  It's because it's a groovy little place with young hipster (and some not so hipster) bartenders and waitresses that serves up an endless array of beers in a funky loud space.  I love Regent Square and always saw the potential for the grand old days of Hippy Free Love lying dormant in her quaint shops and family eateries ... until D's sprang to life in a former dry cleaner/gun shop space.  Oh yes, how the times have changed and we are all so thankful for it.  Big KUDOS to the D's Empire in Regent Square -- the Beer Distributor, D's Six Packs and Dogs, and the newest entrant Cibo!  Well done!  Stop on in for a nice hot pizza (I loved the Frickin Parker with meat balls and hot peppers but alas, it has been banished to the basement beer dungeon for-evah!) or a mediocre hotdog and languish in the beer heaven known simply as D's. They also have a smoky dark strange but intriguing (if you've had enough beer downstairs) bar upstairs now that serves alcohol. Think fresh bread, fresh vegetables, daily sliced meats of the highest caliber served in white butcher paper by very slow service.  Ahhhh, the joys of ordering a torpedo (around six inches of bread) or a Battleship (fasten the hatches!) from the Triangle.  They make the best cold hoagies -- turkey, italian, and ham are among my favorites!  They also have a bar and TV's for that minimalist game viewing adventure with regulars from nearby homestead and braddock propping up the stools.  It's a great take out place -- call ahead though.  A Pittsburgh classic you must try once for a Steeler or Penguin game party.  Terrific!", "user_id": "neBCZl1X_pDl11y7nVYFoQ", "business_id": "WETE_LykpcnrC1sFcQ5EGg"}
{"text": "Papa J's is expensive and inconsistent.  The ambiance is nice but it doesn't justify the prices.  There are better restaurants in Carnegie. This is another one of my favorite places that had deteriorated dramatically. Corporate decided to get rid of the core beers and the beers now suck. The menu has gone from something for everyone to a couple of overpriced entrees and a bunch of small plates that are ok but not great. The service has also suffered tremendously. We are abandoning this restaurant.\n\nI don't expect this Rock Bottom to be around too much longer.  In the past, on nights when the Pirates were playing out of town, the bar and the restaurant would be packed.  Last night, it was only slightly busy.  You can usually tell when an eatery is suffering by the amount of staff on a given night and the conditions of the bathroom.  The staff was overwhelmed and the bathrooms were filthy and in serious need of repairs.  Alas, I don't think that Rock Bottom will still be in business in six months.  Hopefully, if that happens, Black Rock Bar & Steak House will find its way into Pittsburgh. This place has gone downhill and I don't expect that we will be going back. In fact, I don't expect it to be in business past Christmas. They raised their prices, changed the menu, and removed several of our favorite dishes from the menu. The veggie dumplings are gone, the jasmine iced tea is gone, and the mini-dessert are gone. The food is meh. My broccoli was mushy in the ginger chicken and the sauce was like candy because it was too sweet. I love Mitchell's Fish Market.  95% of the time, the food is amazing but, when they mess up, they move heaven and earth to make it better.  The last time we were at Mitchell's, I ordered the lobster and tenderloin skewers.  My lobster was underdone.  The server was amazing and replaced the lobster tail even though I had eaten most of it.  Then, to make our night even better, comped us a dessert.  It's that kind of stellar service that keeps us going back. Old Pittsburgh at its finest.  This place isn't trying to be anything other than what it is  - an excellent old school German restaurant.  The drawback with this restaurant is how crowded and loud it can be during the busy time.  It's much nicer when it's not so busy.  Otherwise, the beer, food and service can't be beat! I love Dunning's.  When I want a good burger, this is the place I visit.  Even when they're busy, I can count on getting my burger the way I ordered it.  The portions are HUGE.  The downside is that this place can be noisy and the wine prices are too high for a 4 ounce pour.  Otherwise, the service is good, the food consistent, and the atmosphere pleasant for a neighborhood pub. I'm sad.  Dunning's last day of business is July 18th.  They are closing and a new restaurant is moving in.  I'm told that the building will be renovated and the new business will open in the fall.  Thank you to the staff of Dunning's.  Your burgers will be sadly missed. This place has gone downhill tremendously. I just had a baby roach drop out of the takeout bag. Never again. Another overdone steak and utterly inattentive staff! Still sitting here waiting for someone to give a care.\n\nSo, we finally got the attention of a server who was not our server, Michael. She was kind enough to take my steak back to the kitchen. Michael, our server, finally shows up 10 minutes later with a half-hearted apology and to let me know that my steak was being prepared again. He does not offer to refill our drink glasses that have now been sitting empty for 20 minutes. The manager makes an appearance and brings me a strip steak that looks rare from the sight of it. He informs me that my steak is on him and apologizes. He goes away. I cut into my steak and it's, you guessed it, Pittsburgh Rare. I asked for medium rare. He returns and I tell him that the chef needs to go back to culinary school and learn how to prepare a steak. The manager apologizes again and asks me if I want to take this pathetic piece of beef home with me! Not only is it rare but it's a cheap cut of strip steak that is loaded with connective gristle. I said no thanks. He comped my husband's meal and we left. I never hope for people to lose their jobs but the cook and the server really need some serious retraining!

{"text": "Just moved to the area, so I was looking for a good sushi place. This is a nice little joint.  It's very intimate, but they would have no problem seating a large party.  When my BF and i arrived we were the only ppl there (it was memorial day, so sushi isn't too high up ppls lists for dinner)  \nWe ordered the spicy Edamame and 4 rolls.  Everything was reasonably priced, and very good.  \nStaff was friendly!\n\nWill definitely be back! I first heard of the Dor-Stop from my Grandma, who asked to go on her next visit here to Pittsburgh.  Apparently, she saw it on a little show call Drive-ins, Dinners, and Dives. lol.\nWhen we first got there it was quite busy so expect a little wait. ( Ours was maybe 10 min to be seated)  Wait b/c you will be glad that you did!!\nCoffee was typical diner coffee, but I love that so I'm a little biased.\nOur server was friendly and efficient.  Our coffee cups never went empty, so that's an A++ in my book.\nI  had the breakfast burrito and split an order of pancake with my grandma and boyfriend.  My burrito was HUGE!!  Stuffed with delicious eggs, potatoes, breakfast meats, and cheese....heaven on a plate.  I couldn't finish but it made great breakfast the next day. The pancakes....oh my lord the pancakes....perfection.   They were fluffy and the perfect balance of sweetness.  So good! We just got the regular ones, but they also offer specials. (the special that day was blueberry. Note to self, come back in fall probably offer pumpkin pancakes.) My grandma had eggs over easy and sausage. She enjoyed both and liked that while sausage is greasy hers wasn't disgustingly greasy.  My boyfriend had an omelet that rivaled the size of my burrito. It was stuffed full of yummy veggies and meat.  \n\nI will never stop praising the Dor-Stop.  This little gem of a place is what Pittsburgh is all about. Best breakfast in Pittsburgh. Every time I come here I'm never failed.  On my most recent adventure I took my Mom and Step dad, who were in for a visit.  There was a special on sausage biscuits with gravy. OH. MY. GOD.   It was so delicious, it was ALMOST was good as my grandma's.  I savored every bite, and my only issue was that there wasn't more.  :(\nAs always the restaurant was packed and loud. I love that about the Dor-Stop b/c it's so Pittsburgh.  Did I mention how much I love this place?!?! I have been a patron of Bado's several times now, and this is a great spot to have few beers, watch a game, and meet up with friends.  Their beer selection is commendable and is frequently updated.  I have sat a the bar and had a table.  I've never had a problem with service.  Staff is knowledgeable and makes great suggestions.  \nNow for the food...their pizza is so yummy!  I love everything about it. The cheese, sauce, toppings...all great.  Their wings are also good.  \nIt can get quite packed during a game or on a weekend evening, so there can be a wait.  Grab a beer and wait b/c it's worth it. This is the WORST Hibachi I have ever had.  We came here for a friends birthday, and I will never be going back. Service was mediocre, but the food was the real travesty.\nYou go to Hibachi for a show, but it's not fun when the cook makes the SAME Giant Eagle joke the entire time.  He also couldn't perform all the tricks that are pretty standard from Hibachi chefs.  The food. Not good.  My boyfriend ordered tofu and it was cold in the middle.  He didn't bother to have the guy heat it more, b/c it would have just been a hassle.  The chef forgot one friends meal completely and got rude with the server.  Then after everything was cooked, he looked at me and asked did you eat all your shrimp. I replied \"no, you never served me any.\" (I had ordered the chicken and shrimp.)  He then sends the server back into the kitchen to get more. By the time they were cooked, everyone was finished eating.  Come on.  To make matters worse, when we left we saw that he was the head chef. That doesn't say too much for the rest of them. \nI don't know how people keep coming here.  There is WAY better hibachi in Pittsburgh, for a lot less money.  I mean honestly, I paid $9.50 for a glass of Kendall Jackson. No. \nThe best part of the meal were the cupcakes that my friend brought.  Do your wallet and your stomach a favor and go to a different Hibachi place.

{"text": "Steak 'n Shake's food is pretty good and the prices aren't bad for the quantity of food. I ordered a grilled chicken salad with no dressing. The salad looked thrown together and was $5.49 for 2 croutons, tomatoes, carrots, cabbage, lettuce and chicken breast. (They forgot the cheese!) The staff wasn't very friendly or helpful and seemed like they didn't want to be there. There usually is a long wait at Steak 'n Shake, but if you catch them when they aren't busy, you will breeze through- drive-thru that is. I do like their food and you can eat healthy options, but the staff isn't helpful and the quality isn't always there. I used to love D&B when it first opened in the Waterfront, but it has gone down hill over the years. The games are not as fun and do not give you as many tickets and the prizes have gotten cheaper in quality. It takes a whole heck of a lot of tickets for you to even get a pencil! The atmosphere is okay but it used to be so much better with the funnest games and diverse groups of people! Now, it is run down and many of the games are app related games (Fruit Ninja) and 3D Experience rides. With such \"games\", you can't even earn tickets and they take a lot of tokens! Last time I went, back in the winter, many of the games were broken, which made for a negative player experience. I would go to D&B to play some games again in the future, but it is no longer one of my favorite places to go due to the decline of fun games where you can earn tickets. Bishops used to be the best pizza place around but anymore, it is mediocre at best! It really just depends on when you get it. Some days it's better and other days it's not. The taste and quality isn't consistent. Just recently we ordered from bishops and the pizza did not have a lot of cheese and the crust wasn't warm or tasty. It just tasted bland. I know that this particular location has been for sale but still operating, so hopefully new management can turn this place around and make it as good as it always used to be! I really enjoy Beto's Pizza because it's truly unlike any other pizza you've had! The dough is hot and the toppings are placed on cold! Be careful, the car ride home really can make the toppings all melt together, which makes the pizza still very good, but not as good as the unique tasting cold toppings that you go to Beto's for! The pizza can get pricey with additional pricing for many of the toppings, but it is totally worth it! The ingredients are so fresh and the pizza is so yummy! Benihana has always been one of my favorite Hibachi places, but the last couple of times we went, service wasn't too good. Our cook appeared to be high and dropped things during his presentation. He had us worried while he controlled the fire of the stove top and flipped items in the air because he just did not seem to be experienced or professional. The food is always very good though and I have never been disappointed by it! The green tea ice cream is especially unique and delicious! I also love their buttery lobster and would definitely order it again! I really hope that Benihana stays strict on who represents them on the floor and monitors their workers' quality of work more because they have the name and the product down.", "user_id": "jThUkO26of_9arLY5zUszg", "business_id": "6ilJq_05xRgek_8qUp36-g"}
{"text": "Some of the worst pizza I've ever had.  We used a coupon from the paper for a 2 topping 8 cut Sicilian. First of all the pizza wasn't even cut through, and the sad attempt at cutting was so uneven that 4 of the slices were about an inch wide, while the others were about 4\" each. The toppings were scarce, they used mini pepperoni and put maybe 8 on the whole pizza. The onions were huge chunks and the mushrooms were straight from a can. The worst part though was the thick doughy crust that tasted more like a fishy sourdough roll. I'm serious... It was so noticeable that it made me wonder if the dough was bad or if they for some weird reason put fish sauce in it. It was gross. \n\nWe also ordered steak and Italian hoagies. The veggies were old and wilted, and there was no dressing on either. The Italian had deli meat that was clearly bottom of the line and not very generous. The \"steak\" (if you an call it that) was greyish instead of brown and looked like it was a processed meat chopped into pieces. No flavor or seasoning and the texture was reminiscent of spam. It was so bad that I only ate 1/4 of it and tossed the rest. \n\nI have ordered from here in the past and always been disappointed. I thought I would give them another try since I'd never ordered a Sicilian pizza from there. What a mistake. I will never order from them again! I used to order takeout here once every month or so. The food tastes average and the price is good. It's your typical low-end Chinese place. \n\nThe last (and final) time I ordered here I just so happened to be picking up my order while a health inspector from allegheny county health department was making his rounds. While I was waiting on my food (which took much longer than usual) the inspector was pointing out violations. He also requested a copy of a certificate that the man behind the register was unable to produce. The inspector looked at me like I was crazy for waiting on my food despite the obvious poor conditions.  \n\nAs for the rest of the place - it's always been kind of dirty inside. The carpets are just FILTHY and the walls match. There are always children's toys scattered about the floor because the owners children are always there, so be careful not to trip. \n\nThe workers do seem like nice people just trying to make a living but when it comes to cleanliness Don Don is lacking. My family and I have been going to Benihana for about 5 years now. We've always had to wait at least a half an hour to be seated, even when we've had reservations. In the past its been forgivable, mostly because its close to home for us, the food is okay (albeit a little pricey), and my Grandmother absolutely loves the entertainment of hibachi. But that all changed last night when we went out with a party of 8 for my and my mothers birthday. \n\nI made reservations two weeks in advance for our birthday dinner. When I called they were almost totally booked and only had a few spots left that evening. Our reservations were for 7:30. \n\nWe arrive a little early at 7:20 and I let the hostess know that we are there and she checks us in. Then we basically just wait and wait and wait. We notice the hostess turning people away, and we notice two tables who have been seated for about 30 minutes now haven't even gotten their soups or salads. By now its nearly 8 O'clock. Then my mother overhears the hostess telling someone that they are short staffed and the wait is going to be extremely long. By this point we've been waiting for 45 minutes. My sister takes a walk through the restaurant and notices there is only 1 hibachi chef working, but there are SEVEN tables seated, all waiting for food/drinks. So I ask the hostess how much longer before we are seated. She informs me that it will be at least another half an hour before we get a table, because two hibachi chefs and two kitchen chefs called off sick. It would be another hour after were seated before they would even start taking our food orders. \n\nThis is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. First of all, the hostess should have informed us when we arrived that they were short staffed and we would have a very very long wait. OR, the manager should have phoned people with reservations and asked if they could reschedule. Either way, we should have been informed instead of letting us stand in the lobby for an hour, not knowing that it would be another hour and a half before we would actually eat, on an evening when we had reservations. \n\nWe decided to call Ichiban to see if they could accommodate us. They told us we could walk right in and be seated immediately. As we were leaving we ran into a gentleman who was outside smoking who told us that his party had reservations for 6:30 and they still had not ordered their food! It was now about 8:20pm. \n\nOur first dinner at Ichiban actually turned out to be much better than our previous dinners at Benihana, so I don't think we'll ever be going back there. I think Ichiban will be our new hibachi restaurant of choice.", "user_id": "fTg6Rz2Rs1LLYN_U7TJbcQ", "business_id": "6o3RK6rTcN3nw-j-r2nQmA"}

After a few more minutes we decided we wanted to enjoy Sushi for lunch and so we placed our order to the waiter and asked if our starters were about ready in which he replied yes they should be out shortly.  Instead 2 of our 4 Sushi orders come out followed by Edimame and then followed by the Shrimp Tempura 5 minutes after that.  We then proceeded to ask about the soup and rest of our Sushi order, we were informed the soup takes a very long time and that the Sushi was being made still.  (we understood why the Sushi may take a little more time due to what we ordered)  The Edimame was very delicious, but the Shrimp Tempura had me baffled at what we had ordered and why the cost was $8 for the very small portioned flavorless Tempura, which included I'm assuming a thousand island dressing for some reason?  It was definitely not your normal Tempura sauce in which we've enjoyed many times before in other Benihana locations.  As we get our 2nd batch of Sushi our soup was still NOT ready.  Is this a lack of service, food staff, or poor kitchen management with untrained so called \"Chefs\"?  We decided it was best to simply cancel the soup in which then we were coincidentally informed the soup was ready and if we still wanted it.  During this whole ordeal, we had not seen our original waiter since we had placed our orders and instead had 2 other employees that had no clue what we ordered and had to run back and forth asking what we had and what we were waiting for still.  I wouldn't have minded being informed our original waiter was busy and they were going to take over for him, had our order been alright, or even if had our food been tasty.  The Tempura was horrible, the Sushi was questionable, and the service was beyond ridiculous.  If you're wondering what was so bad about the Sushi, I'll make it simple for you.  Looks and taste both scored a 3 out of 10.  Lack of knowledge of the Sushi from the employees should of been a red flag to us from the get go, instead we took a chance.  We love Benihanas, but never again at this location.  From our experience with Hibachi type establishments we've always encountered great personalities, great service, and tasty food that left us wanting to come back for that experience.

{"text": "I've been a regular at Bado's for a few years now, and have yet to be disappointed. I've had everything here; brunch (eggs can be greasy but everything else is good), lunch, dinner, PIZZA, even just for drinks, I've had it all here. Bado's pizza is one of the best pizzas I've ever had!  It can be a little pricey with toppings, but it's worth it.  I love their rotating beer menu as there's usually something to keep me happy. The service is always good as well. We usually sit at the bar so the bartenders know us well.  Bado's gets two thumbs up from this girl! Triangle serves up the best hoags in Pgh, hands down, one of a kind and delicious! Their Battleships are such an easy thing to take to a tailgate or game day party, always a crowd pleaser! Besides the battleship they also have a delicious fried fish sandwich that I would definitely recommend for lent. They also carry Turner's Tea, and you really can't eat a Triangle hoagie without having Turner's to wash it down with. \n\nI would also recommend calling in your order ahead of time because it can get really busy in there. Plus during lent they might run out of fish, and you don't want to be without that delicious crispy fish. If you do call in, you can skip the line and go to the right side of the store to pick up your order. No matter what, it's worth the wait! This Benihana location is pretty great, I must say. We eat there a few times a year, but most recently for my daughter's 10th birthday. She wanted the Beni shrimp, and she had such a good time! Our waitress Minsook was so sweet and attentive to our party, I can't say enough about her. \n\nThe thing I don't like about hibachi is waiting for a table, so I definitely recommend making a reservation (can be done on their website) and going on a weeknight. I also don't like crowds and I was surprised at the fact that it wasn't very busy on a Thursday night. The wait time for our table was surprisingly very fast, too! We had 6 in our party and I appreciate that they didn't throw 2 strangers at our table. \n\nI deducted one star because since we've eaten hibachi so many times, the 'show' is starting to get a little boring. The onion volcano and zucchini boat are great but give us more! Mad Mex is a pretty cool place and I like the atmosphere a lot. I would suggest using the No Wait app if you want a table during dinner hours, it gets super busy and the wait can be upwards of an hour! Speaking of, last Friday I used the No Wait app for a table for 2. We got there when we were next in line, and the host even said we were next. About 10 minutes later he sat two other 2 person parties ahead of us. Then we were next. It was a little strange? I can get over it, but yes, strange. \n\nAnyway, I would also suggest ordering a marg as soon as you sit because they are phenomenal! Happy hour prices are a great deal, too. I also love their chips and salsas, free if you sit at the bar and the salsa is always fresh and delish! Every meal I've gotten here has been good, but I think my favorite (and my fiance's, too) is the Nacho Mamma Taco Platter. The service is also always great! \n\nKeep making those delicious margs and I will keep coming back!", "user_id": "WG3nRWr_RPm7cImK869wKA", "business_id": "qemCNgjeYGcFsRwxW9x4xw"}
{"text": "Gab n Eat is the best breakfast in Pittsburgh and always a treat.  We went there around 11:30 which brought up the lunch. Vs breakfast debate. I saw another customers soup and knew i would have to try it. The soup was a  Lobster Bisque and it was amazing.....creamy deliciousness. I could have had a quart of it. Yum!  I ended up ordering the create your own mixed grill. (When at Gab n Eat. You have to order the 1/2 grill) I had mine with bacon. Bacon was crisp and delish. and M ordered the regular mixed grill. We also shared an order of potato pancakes. They even brought us 2 sides of applesauce and sour cream. The pancakes could have been a tiny bit crisper, but still very good. I'm sorry to give any stars...15 minutes for a cup of coffee, while waitress flitted around...waited another 10 minutes and after 25 minutes of sitting there with the menu closed..I left. Coffee and water untouched. Waitress was too busy telling the customer in the next booth about her daughters almost wedding. Don't waste your time or money at this Denny's. Service is horrible and waitresses are the worst...food usually isn't great..but I can't speak for this visit...25 minutes and no one wanted to take my order. Ps...Kings had a great breakfast that day...service was great...only about 1.5 miles down the road. Great experience at the Huddle tonight. Our first time there,the bartender was great. Very friendly and made us feel welcome. Other customers were nice and we enjoyed talking with them. Homemade soups were so good we took some to go...and Philly Cheese steak was great. Not even one complaint. This used to be one of my favorite places for breakfast but the quality has diminished noticeably. Eggs over medium were runny and the pumpkin pancakes, that used to be my reason for going, lacked flavor...they were very bland and were a little raw on the inside. Maybe the food is better when they aren't so busy? Best pizza in the city..unless you want Sicilian style..then hit Betos. We ordered and inhaled a medium everything pizza and a half steak half Italian hoagie....we should have gotten a large and whole hoagies. Delicious and the pizza was bubbly hot and fresh out of the oven. I didn't mind waiting as the guys behind the counter were friendly, funny and genuinely fun to talk too. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the hoagies could use a little more meat on them...but still yummy! Pizza crust is perfect...not too thin, not to thick and crunchy. I can't wait til our next Camps night!! Very disappointed in our delivery order this evening. The potato soup was runny, and looked like milky water with a few potatoes in it. The wedding soup was less than fair. Thee Buffalo chicken sandwich had no lettuce or tomato on it. The Reuben and fries were soggy and greasy. The chicken salad, the lettuce was wilted, although the chicken strips were the best thing in the whole order. The turkey grilled sandwich also had no lettuce or tomato and was greasy and soggy and did not come with the chips and pickles as listed on the menu. For what they charged for this. It was a disgrace . We will not order again and will pass the word around. There are too many other  decent and less expensive delivery restaurants to ever order from there again. Disappointed. I wish I didn't have to give even 1 star. Horrible service. I ordered family dinner for 4 plus 2 extra sides. I got sighs and eye rolls from the cook and the girl waiting on me. I got home and no extra sides. I paid for them but they didn't put them in the bag. I called and was told that they would send me a card for family dinner for 3 since they charged me for items not received. I called again on July 2nd as they never sent anything. I spoke with Autumn who advised me that she was a manager and would send out a gift card as previously promised. Still have not received. So if you choose this location make sure to check your order because they love to charge you for items you won't receive and have no follow through. I would be happy to get my 10.00 back. This started on June 24th. Terrible servce. We went there at least 1x a month and had no problem spending money, but I'd rather spend that 60.00 somewhere else.

{"text": "Best Irish food in the Burgh.  Great bar food too.  The service is maybe a bit surly and it's not the cleanest, nor the best decor.  But, that's not what this place is about.  It's a town Irish bar and it serves great solid Irish fare and suds to the locals.  And it does it better than anyone.  I go back again and again. As with all of the fast food restaurants in this area of Ohio River Blvd., this place is dumpy and dirty.  The staff is also poorly supervised ,and I've been privvy to more store gossip, drama, and horseplay than I've ever experienced in any restaurant, fast food or otherwise.  They get so loud back in the kitchen that we will often stop our conversation in the dinning room to wait for them to quiet down a bit before we continue.  The food itself is generally passable. This is a pretty decent Arby's, and given the condition of the other fast food restaurants on this stretch of Ohio River, it practically reaches exceptional.  The dining room is clean and nicely modern.  The service is friendly.  I don't think I've ever had a bad experience. I really wanted to like the Rusty Nail.  I love little local restaurants like this.  But it really is a very tight squeeze, to begin with.  They really need to pull some tables out of there to make more room.  We were right on top of another table with two very loud young children, and there was just no buffer.  And the food was.... just so bland!  I get that it was supposed to be homestyle cooking, but it just had no flavor.  To be fair, we did go for dinner, and I understand that this place is more of a breakfast joint, so I would be willing to try it again sometime for breakfast.  For dinner though, unless you like super-bland food, I probably wouldn't return for seconds. I definitely love this place!  A fantastic example of a little neighborhood restaurant just serving perfect hand-made food and getting it right.  The food is so savory and just melts in your mouth.  You can't go wrong with the specials.  My only complaints (which are minor) are that parking can be a bit of an issue (street parking only) and for the love of god, you need to make reservations (they get a bit shirty with you if you don't).  But these are so minor, I don't even think they affect my rating at all.  The food is phenomenal and the atmosphere is wonderful. Ugh, I hate this place.  People from work drag me here to lunch more often than I would like.  The food is overpriced.  The service is snotty and slow.  I can barely get free in under an hour-and-a-half.  The food is forgettable and the menu sparse.  They're terrible for pick-up too - even when you call way ahead, you're made to wait, and they're surly about taking care of you when you arrive for your food.  You can do better for lunch on the northshore pretty much anywhere.  Try SoHo or Finnegan's instead. Another lunch spot for the northshore.  This probably has the best food.  The french dip and the wraps are very good.  It's a tad pricey but not horrible.  They're really good for pickup.  As is a constant problem on the northshore, service is INCREDIBLY slow.  You won't get out of here in under an hour if you dine in.  The waitresses are just MIA with refills and bringing checks, and the food takes a while to come out too.  But if you have time to spend, it's probably the best lunch spot on the north shore.

Adult games!\n\nThe Homestead (Pittsburgh) location of Dave & Busters is just one of the almost 50 locations across the country - from New York to Florida to California - - from Canada to Mexico.  \n\nThe Dave & Busters idea was conceived in Little Rock, Arkansas back in the 1970s. Two different businesses (one a popular watering hole & one a game & entertainment business) were right next door to each other. The two young owners were friends and quickly realized that combining their businesses made perfect sense. So they opened the first combined D & B in  . . . . no, not Little Rock, but Dallas! To this day there are no D & B's in Little Rock. Not sure what is up with that! But lots of other cities have been the beneficiaries of these two friends combining their businesses.\n\nThe one in Pittsburgh is the only one I have ever been to.  When I lived there, a group of friends and co-workers (and me, of course!)used to go there for Happy Hour & Power Hour . . . . at least once a week. We had a blast!  A great place to kick-back and let the worries of the work day melt away.\n\nWonder if they'll ever open one in Marin County, CA? Shucks!  Probably not. Not a Marin County scene, for sure. \n\nWHAT A BLAST IT WAS THOUGH! I miss going to D & B. They have all the classics, like billiards & shuffleboard, plus over 200 interactive & video games. A rechargable Power Card provides an easy way to access all the games.  \n\nPOWER HOUR is game HAPPY HOUR - - an entire hour of classic and video games for just  ten bucks.  \n\nA GREAT BAR, WONDERFUL FOOD AND SERVICE! A RELAXING AND FUN WAY to spend a Friday or Saturday evening. You'll never want to leave. Meet your friends here, grab a beer and a burger or steak and hit the games. \n\nTime will just evaporate . . . . while you laugh and drink with your favorite girl, your best friend or even your boss!  \n\nDAVE & BUSTERS! LOTS OF PARKING! LOTS OF FUN!\n\nFUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! . . . . BRING ON THE BEER! LUNCH:  This was one of my favorite lunch spots when I lived and worked in Pittsburgh. I was a creature of habit though - - for lunch I very seldom strayed from their wonderful lobster bisque and a nice mixed green salad. It was the perfect lunch. Served quickly, which gave me plenty of time for the nice walk to and from work.\n\nDINNER: For dinner, when I had more time, it was always nice to venture into one of their other great seafood offerings. They have a couple of great salmon dishes that I really like and a striped bass. All seafood is fresh and prepared with care. Chicken and steak, but I never tried them - -  too many good seafood choices. Very nice presentations.\n\nSUSHI: They have an extensive sushi menu - for those of you who are big sushi fans. Me?  Not so. But I have friends who are and they rave about the sushi here. \n\nOne of the things I like best about this place is that the menu includes info on where your dinner was born, raised and caught.\n\nSUSTAINABLE FISHES\nThey exclusively serve Lummi Island Salmon\nhttp://www.lummiislandwild.com \n\nTilapia, NC\nLouisiana Catfish, LA\nAtlantic Salmon\nRainbow Trout, ID \n \nWILD LINE CAUGHT FISH\nDayboat Fluke, NJ\nLummi Island Salmon, BC \nTombo, HI\nWaluu, HI\nShutome Swordfish, HI\nStriped Bass, NJ\nPintado, Brasil \nChilean Sea bass\n#1 Ahi Tuna, HI\nMahi Mahi, C.R.\nWild Sea Scallops, MA\nDiver Scallops, Baja \n7 oz. Lobster Tail, SA\n \nFor an inland seafood restaurant this one rivals many costal ones I've eaten at. Definitely an upscale, pleasant place to eat lunch or dinner. Great service, quiet relaxed atmosphere. \n\nYes, it is a little pricey. If you want cheap fried seafood, head on over to Long John Silvers or Captain D's. But I bet you can't get them to tell you where their seafood came from . . . even if they know!  And, even if they do, you probably don't want to know!\n\nYou get what you pay for - in both food & service.", "user_id": "rjsx6_pSqwl0zuiwa_tI2g", "business_id": "sbW8qHJgzEIH42B0S-3New"}
{"text": "I really don't know why I bother with chain restaurants anymore.  Now that my palate has matured and I no longer think chicken fingers and french fries are gourmet cuisine, I really can't find anything to eat in a place like this.  \n\nMy husband and I were running errands at the Waterfront, and we needed to find a place for lunch.  We decided on Uno because pizza sounded good to us.  My husband is a meat lover, so I agreed to let him order us a meat-covered pizza.  To counteract this a little, I ordered a tomato mozzarella salad, so we'd at least have some vegetables in the mix.  \n\nWhen the salad arrived, it did NOT look like the picture.  The menu description is thus: \"chopped lettuce, roma tomatoes with basil and garlic, buffalo mozzarella, drizzled with balsamic syrup.\"  This description is accompanied by a bright, colorful picture of a salad with bright green lettuce, bright red tomatoes, and a delicate \"drizzling\" of balsamic syrup.  It looks light and yummy.\n\nWhat we got, however, was soggy yellow and white iceberg lettuce, COMPLETELY DRENCHED in dressing, a total of four tiny pieces of tomato, and some cheese.  It was DISGUSTING.  There was so much dressing dripping off of this dish, it was more like a soup than a salad.  I suspect that the lettuce was so wilted and brown, they figured they could disguise it by completely soaking it in dressing.  Not only was it disgusting, but it cost us about $10.  $10 for complete inedible slop.  \n\nThe \"numero uno\" pizza we got was nothing to write home about either.  It was ok... very mediocre.  The crust tasted like it was undercooked, and the sauce tasted like plain tomato sauce with no seasoning whatsoever.  I have been to Chicago many times, had real Chicago deep dish many times, and this just doesn't even come close to the real thing.  \n\nThe ONLY positive I give this restaurant is they have the kiosk in the front where you can look up the calorie count of the food right there.  It would be better if they'd actually print it on the menu, but they are still doing better than most restaurants in this effort.  They are making strides, too, with their whole grain crust options.  I'm sure there's still a lot of room for improvement, however.  If you're listening, Uno, please work on providing your customers with healthier food - not just healthy options like salads, but work on making the main dishes you serve better for your customers (low-fat cheese, low-sugar sauce, less sodium, etc.).   Their hearts will applaud you.  \n\nAnd lastly, why does every chain restaurant have to decorate with old signs?  Is there some sort of chain restaurant decorating requirement I don't know about?  It's baffling. Terrible.\n\nI visited this restaurant for the first time yesterday to use up a Groupon.  Thank God I didn't pay full price for this slop.  \n\nFirst, lets talk about the decor.  Others have commented about the outdated 80s look of the place. I concur.  The chairs are ridiculously heavy and uncomfortable.  And don't even get me started on the hideous glass constructions hanging from the ceiling.  \n\nSecond, let talk about the staff.  Unprofessional to say the least.  When we were waiting for our table, I witnessed the hostess yell at a man from across the restaurant, instead of walking up to him and guiding him to his party.  \"Hey Anthony, your party's over here!\"  Ridiculous. \n\nThis restaurant has an open kitchen, which is usually a good thing - but not when everyone's yelling at each other.  We were seated near the kitchen and, I'm not exaggerating, heard someone yell \"order!\" approximately every 30 seconds.  Staff yelled at each other from across the restaurant constantly.  I felt like I was on a playground.  \n\nOur waitress was a nice, sweet girl, and she did the best she could considering the environment she was in.  I have no complaints about her.  \n\nThe food, though... Jesus.  We started with the \"margarita shrimp cocktail\".  Imagine tiny round pieces of popcorn shrimp floating in a glass of lime flavored water.  These were served with tortilla chips, which you'd think were meant to be used to scoop up the shrimp from the glass.  But, the shrimp are solid round balls, not a scoopable salsa.  We tried picking up the shrimp with the chips, but they'd just roll off and end up on the floor.  My date and I just laughed as we TRIED to eat this concoction.  When it finally made it into our mouths, it was gross anyway.  \n\nMy boyfriend ordered a sushi/sashimi combo platter.  I'm being generous by giving it a rating of mediocre.  Take out sushi from a grocery store is better.  \n\nNow, I admit, I made the mistake here - I ordered the fried fish platter.  I'm used to getting a variety at seafood restaurants.  At a place like Mitchell's Fish Market, you can get a dish with a piece of fish, a few scallops, a few shrimp, and a vegetable.  The Original Fish Market has no such dish.  The only dish I could get that had more than just one piece of fish with some plain steamed white rice and steamed spinach, was the fried fish platter.  So, I ordered that, with a side of green beans (vegetables were $5 - $7 extra).\n\nThe description said I would get a piece of tilapia, scallops, oysters, shrimp, and french fries.  I didn't realize this meant that the tilapia was fried, the scallops were fried, the oysters were fried, and the shrimp was fried, all on top of a giant bed of fried french fries.  It's just not what I pictured.  Like I said, it was my mistake for not reading carefully and not asking the waitress, but lets say for argument's sake that this is what I wanted.  \n\nIt was still disgusting.  The batter/flavor was exactly the same for everything.  The scallops tasted like the french fries.  The shrimp tasted like the french fries, the tilapia tasted like the french fries.  I didn't even try the oysters, but I'm pretty sure they would have tasted like french fries.  I ate barely a quarter of this dish, and I'm pretty sure I consumed an entire week's worth of saturated fat.  If you ate this entire plate, I think a heart attack would interrupt your dessert.\n\nThe green beans were good. \n\nOther people commented that you can't count on hotel restaurants being worthwhile.  I have to agree.  If everyone's just passing through, you don't have to worry about actually impressing anyone and getting them to come back.  And with business travelers, they're usually paying with their company's dime, so they don't bother to complain or expect much.\n\nI have learned my lesson.  I'm not coming back.  And I seriously question the sanity of people who gave this place more than two stars.", "user_id": "INVBi5surB5UbeDXWmqSuQ", "business_id": "6p9TlP2I8S4agxYMNFSDjg"}
{"text": "Let's just start with the elephant in the room...picture a vintage Arnold Schwarzenegger flexing his biceps in the mirror. This is the framed \"art\" inside the women's restroom located on the 2nd floor. Odd. I nearly poked my eyes out with my mascara brush from staring. It's hypnotizing.\n\nNow that we got that out of the way, let's talk about  the restaurant!\n\nAfter months of whining, a group of 8 of us finally decided to nut up or shut up and finally made plans. (Thank you, Samantha B. for organizing!)\n\nGetting a reservation for 8 is not an easy task. The building is a three-story, traditional townhouse  that is very narrow leaving only so much space inside for the dining area, bar, and the kitchen. And, it is located in the middle of Allentown. Yes, Allentown. This fact could qualify as the baby elephant in the room but it seems to be the trend to operate fantastic restaurants in areas that would make your average xenophobe from suburbia go bat shit cray cray.  And, for the record, I'm not drinking Hatorade. I was equally \"scurred\"  during the drive up E. Warrington Avenue...and I live in the East End where hipsters and old school hippies are known to reside and give peace a chance. \n\nThe reality is what it is. It's a scary part of town but it did not matter a damn when we got out of the car. It was a Saturday night and we were greeted by an average Joe  valet who sincerely welcomed us to the restaurant  and told us to enjoy our dinner. The locals who walked by smiled and nodded as if they were giving us their approval. It's as if the restaurant was under a dome, protected by a force field that doesn't allow the stereotypical nonsense most would fear when entering Allentown at night. \n\nWe were greeted by our server who immediately took our drink orders. I didn't see a bar on the first floor so I almost hesitated to order my usual dirty martini and my sweetheart's Manhattan, thinking they were limited in their mixology. Orders were taken without pause and both drinks were most impressive. Our friends enjoyed vino rossos and biancos from their diverse wine list that is 100% Italia! \n\nTables are set with \"Holy Oil\" for dipping artisanal Italian breads, a seasoned cheese and cecci bean gustoso, and, my favorite, a fresh goat cheese olive spread.\n\nWe started with the artichoke appetizer special and shared the meatball appetizer with the rest of the table. Yes, shared. The meatball is bigger than Barry Bonds and Kanye West's egos combined. And, it was friggin' fantastic. The flavors, the marinara sauce, the mozzarella stuffed inside...If I could marry a meatball, this would be matrimonial bliss.\n\nMy sweetheart chose the highly recommended veal chop Milanese. This is yet another piece of meat listed on the menu not small in size. Because I am always the a-hole of the group, I asked if I could have Linguine and Clam sauce instead of the pasta prep on the menu. Again, no hesitation. Wow. But the groans from my our table makes me still an a-hole. I DON'T CARE! IT WAS MY CARB DAY DAMNIT! :-)\n\nOur entrees did not disappoint. TASTY!!!! The entrees minus the pasta came with salad and pasta side served family style. Lots of food to be shared.\n\nWe finished with the hand-spun espresso gelato. Others at the table went for other gelato flavors and the Tiramisu. We all had spoons to share. All were \"delish\".\n\nI was tempted to order the other highly recommended entree, the Cowboy Steak Diane. My friend Beth had the pleasure. The wild mushrooms on her dish looked just as big as the meatballs and she raved about the Worcestershire butter. She offered me a sample but I was too full and ready to birth my food baby.\n\nOh yeah. How could I forget! Franco Harris walked in. SHUT UP!!! Not entirely surprising after viewing the wall on the second floor covered with photos of VIPs posing with the chef/owner. \n\nIt's great to see a gem in Allentown that can shine a light on the other diamonds in the ruff in that area. But don't let  the neighborhood fool you. This restaurant is VERY high end in service, cuisine, price, and atmosphere.\n\nI really enjoyed my experience at Alla Familigia so maybe it wasn't such a coincidence they placed The Terminator's Mr. Universe pic in the restroom...because... I'll be back. I've been meaning to go back to the Fish Market for so long. I remember the great crab legs I had years ago. I finally had the chance last week and was surprisingly disappointed.\n\nThe service was great. We sat at the bar and in no time both bartenders greeted us with smiles and menus. I guess my main concern was the food quality. I ordered the beet salad with warm goat cheese (was not warm at all) and shrimp and scallop linguine. Both were not unique in flavor or presentation. It was as if I made it in my own kitchen. My boyfriend enjoyed his lobster bisque and his seafood jambalya that was perfectly spicy.\n\nI do applaud the venue for offering a diverse and affordable wine list. And, with all due respect to owners, I think the atmosphere needs a serious update in character and aesthetics. Especially since other key hotels are more pleasing to the eye. This should be vital to one of the BEST hotels in the city! \n\nI'd like to return someday to give it another go. We shall see.\n\nP.S. Invest in better wine glasses. Ugly. Ugly.

{"text": "I really was missing Voluto before its new ownership / management took over, on Penn Ave.  I Needed a new place to try with friends who live in Highland Park for an excellent cup of fancy Joe. I'm a steamed milk kind of gal.\n\nStarbucks bless them when I am in a rush but i have to order a tripple just to get a hint of my fix, but the coffee here is the right strength to cover my caffeine withdrawals. Lovely atmosphere small but not tiny, outdoor seating if you want it. Their espresso shots are not served in steamed cups.\n\nTake note if you're a hardcore ezzzspresso shooter and you like it piping hot. I am sure if you asked they could probably warm the cup. The baristas are so friendly and laid back and funny. Also the staff members let me use the bathroom after closing one time perfect gentlemen :) \n\nA decent selection of yummy pastries to compliment your coffee awaits from apple turnovers to decadent brownies.\n\nI also like the crowd that comes here, there are younger people, older peopler and everyone inbetween (the 30 somethings and 40 somethings) my age group. It has a neighborhood feel but I can tell people come from surrounding areas, Tazza is a great example of merging the old and new in Pittsburgh while maintaining the character of its home borough. Yum! I think Ive been here three times since moving to PGH, \n\nFav dogs: Chihuahua , Brat, and Chicago style dog. Never tried other entrees but their fries are nice and crispy. \n\nThey have plenty of Belgian beers to choose from a bonus in my beer book.\n\nBeers: usually a good variety on tap plus tons of variety if you need to one stop shop and pick some six packs up in the back. \n\nWarning though if it is a busy summer evening you can wait up to one hour for your dog I think this is because they have tiny kitchen behind the bar. So if you're super hungry go early or later or fill up on their beer first. \n\nAlso this doesn't really bother me i still ate my food but the guy cooking the food didn't wear gloves and did touch the food with his bare hands often. If you're OCD maybe just get a beer or don't sit at the bar where you can see this. Don't worry he didn't pick anything up off the floor and put it back on plates, i checked. :) I haven't had a full meal here but I had one of the best drink's of my life... The Sapphire Collins and it was amazing. That is coming from a non Gin drinker, so tasty and made just right not too boozy! \n\nThen I had the most mouth watering crispy light Calamari to go with it, completely enjoyable. My friend was unimpressed with her Sushi, but to be fair she is unimpressed with everything in life. \n\nWhat I liked about this place was the location on Penn ave was close to many cultural district venues. I would give this place a shot if you're gunshy about previous reviews and prices just try an appetizer and drinks like I did as a before evening out spot its great! This rating is for the drinks only and atomosphere, and based on my personal taste a bit ok  a big bit. This is definately a \"I'm a young professional pittsburgh business person and I've arrived.\" Status bar or \"I'm a young college girl and I've just had my first boob job care to help fund my nose job too?\" Bar , I did not try the food becaused I moved from a place where we have awesome brazilian restaurant where fresh meats melt in your mouth accompanied by tart sweet grilled pineapple, and real slow cooked brazilian beans mmmm. Soooo after seeing how pittsburgh does Mexican food I'm not willing to drop my pennies to risk the disapointment of pittsbugh attmepts brasilian. \n\nThe bar is roomy with nice lounge seating which is nice for those who don't want to participate in the round the bar meat market. The guys make for fun people watching, either all suits or in their pirates jerseys. Or the occaisional jersey shore look a like meat heat in his v neck t shirt who is too good to attempt so much as a toe tap to the beat of the music. Then there's the balding old man with twenty something on his arm who already looks like she has botoxed up her face in an attempt to mirror her idol kim k. There are few older gay gentlemen I would have liked to chat with who mad things a little more interesting. There was an awesome looking woody Allen meets Andy Warhol look a like with cool glasses, and an awesome white frizzy mane.\n\nThe women range from down to earth girlfriends in for chat, drink and dance to wifes and girlfriends grinding it up on the dance floor with their man to the cougars. Warning Cougar dance zone, these women looked decent though and I'll give it to em they weren't afraid to shake it. \n\nMy biggest gripe about this place (I know I haven't gotten there yet), the drinks are sugary syrup crap. You can only put too many sugary alcohols together before you get a tummyache, you might as well be drinking the syrup flavors starbucks puts in your coffee. Stick to something on the rocks or a vodka soda most places cannot screw that up too badly (aside from Bar louie) but I will get to them later. Price is lame also 8 bucks and up for a mojito and they use coconut rum in it! Yuck. Sorry my college days of only being able to handle coconut rum are over, it is was frat guys give girls with a roofie.\n\nAnyway moving on my biggest gripe was that there is a cop standing by the door, who looks like he just walked away from beating a non white person to death. I know I know cops have the hardest job and I will be the first to say it, but this guy has a thick energy so nasty it hits you in the face from across the room. The way he was looking at the non white people who were a little to \"loud\" for his tastes, no louder than the booming music mind you. Made my stomach churn. Also they used him to close at 1:15am on a saturday. Thats pretty lame for a downtown bar just because they were not packed. Bars in Salt Lake City Utah do that, come on BossaNova this is pittsburgh aka  drinkersville, not mormondryville.

{"text": "Ugh... I got a plate with seisage, tofu scramble, and sundried tomato toast. My whole plate was entirely dry, chewy, and unpalatable. I had high hopes for the tofu scramble, especially after seeing positive reviews about it. But honestly... It tasted like nothing. I thought it'd be moister with a creamy consistency that might come from silken tofu, but it was hard, dry, and chewy. Hubby got a country burrito that was much better in comparison to my plate... But that might have been due to the fact that his whole plate was doused in gravy. Anything will taste better drenched in gravy. We think the gravy tastes like the powdered packet kind where you just add water. On top of all this service wasn't the greatest. I had to fish around for my own ketchup and they didn't even bother to ask me what kind of toast (3 options on the menu)I wanted when I ordered the toast option for my meal. Then they didn't bother to ask hubby if he wanted anything to drink after he had picked one of the $12 entrees that come with coffee or juice. We had to tell someone else to get it for us. Also they don't really wash their cups. There are 2 sink basins at the front where they just dunk the cups in one soapy basin then dunk the cups in a second water basin and then stack them next to the sink. It made me not want to drink my water even though I was thirsty. Good idea, but poorly executed food. I've had good vegan and vegetarian food before that's consisted of a lot of fresh greens, avocados, and more. For a vegetarian place, there was nothing green on our plates. This experience sadly fell enormously short of our expectations... Could've eaten at kaya or meat and potatoes for the same price. Surprisingly really good food here! We had a groupon to use for the night and came in on a Friday afternoon during happy hour... Apparently that is when they are busiest. The buffalo chicken dip with pita chips was really good, and you really can't beat half priced during happy hour (there were 3 to choose from for half off)! I think they must deep fry the pita chips, otherwise I don't know how else they get to be so good... Although the dip could definitely use more chicken. We took the leftover cream cheese home and added a can of white chicken breast meat to make it better. \n\nWe tried the seared ahi tuna, Jamaican jerk chicken burger and the Maui wow and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert. Theirs has got to be the best creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e I've had in a really long time. It's got a nice thin crisp bruleed crust and you really taste the vanilla bean inside. The Maui wow was great too! It had real coconut and pineapple bits and had a light and fluffy consistency. The seared tuna tasted really fresh and was plated beautifully. Hubby liked his jerk burger, along with the generous helping of sweet potato fries it came with. Also, they use  pretty good bread in their sandwiches... \n\nThe only real drawback was how packed and disorganized it appeared to be. Because it was our first time, we were really confused as to whether we were supposed to seat ourselves or not, and where to sit. It also smells like cigarettes, because lots of people smoke outside and come in and out constantly. However, our waitress was really great and she never had to write down any of our orders but still got everything just right. \n\nWorth it, and plan on coming back! :]", "user_id": "nr036PbhhQDdS6wSywErag", "business_id": "PzG0XmAmtXFs6Fdnubf41g"}
{"text": "I wasn't excited about Max's when I first walked in. There were no servers in evidence and I wandered through the entire restaurant looking for an employee to seat me before finally asking the bartender to help. After that, though, things definitely improved. I loved the slightly shabby, old-world vibe. The old photos on the wall were interesting, and the menu slash old newspaper was a pretty cute presentation. \n\nWe got appetizers for dinner, and my favorite by miles was the potato pocket with grilled onions on top. (Basically a pierogi.) So good. So, so good. I actually wasn't as excited about the potato pancakes as I expected - maybe because I was expecting more of a latke style flavor profile? Not sure. We also got the stuffed pretzels - total heart attack on a plate - in a good way! I loved that everything we got came with dipping sauces. So fun. \n\nOverall a positive experience. I'd go back. I almost turned around and left after going in here this afternoon, but I was too hungry to walk away from the amazing smell that surrounds this place for about three blocks. Ok so glad I didn't let the total lack of ambiance or AC turn me off! The people are great and the BBQ and macaroni salad are the best I've ever had. I didn't even know I could eat a half a chicken, but I sure did today! If if been alone, I'm pretty sure I'd have licked the plate, too. This place is amazing. Make sure you have cash on hand! I had lunch here, and I was skeptical of the buffet at first. It turned out to be really tasty, though. Lots of variety, good spice level, and the staff kept an eye on it so that nothing sat too long. I'll definitely go back for dinner sometime. I've been wanting to try Bado's for awhile, and finally did a few days ago. I didn't want to leave the house, though, so I thought I'd check out their delivery service. \n\nI got a thin crust pizza, and the only thing I didn't like was how floppy it was. It ended up being easier to cut it with a knife and fork than to hold it. Not a big deal, especially considering how tasty the pizza was! Fresh basil and garlic, and the pepperoni was nice and crispy and well cooked. It was an awesome indulgence. \n\nAdditionally, the driver was really personable, and my order was at my door in 40 minutes, which is a lot faster than I expected on a Friday night! \n\nThis is definitely going to become a staple of my Pittsburgh food experience! Horrible service. I mean HORRIBLE. \n\nWent during a non-peak time. Pretty quiet in there, not a lot going on. Three employees who were sitting around chatting watched me and my my disabled, elderly friend stand and wait for long, endless minutes without doing anything. I finally went over to the bartender - also hanging out and chatting and watching us stand there - to ask if a hostess was available. Her response? \"Oh, I can seat you.\"\n\nReally? Then why did I have to ask you to!?\n\nThen, the young male waiter assigned to our table just laughed when my companion asked where the restrooms are. WTF?\n\nLook, guys, that would be crummy service to anyone, but to treat an elderly person with a disability like that is just unconscionable. \n\nWe left and won't be back. I'm reviewing Olive Or Twist strictly as a weekday lunch person.  I haven't had drinks there, or been there during an evening or weekend rush.\n\nI absolutely love this place.  Its seating area is small - maybe seven or eight tables?  The lunch menu is delicious.  I get the grilled cheese and tomato soup every time, and it's perfect.  The friend I go with gets the French Dip and sings its praises all day long.\n\nThe prices are a bit on the high side - over $10 for lunch - but frankly, the food is so good I'm glad to pay the extra couple of dollars.  \n\nThe bartender is always the same guy when I go, and if he's the only one up front who has to seat me I get a distinctly unhappy vibe off him.  Killing him with kindness does not work.  Other than him, the staff seems great, and I'm happy to give them my business.", "user_id": "1h5T9mNgReCiykYCxvI55A", "business_id": "IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ"}
{"text": "Pizza is a staple for me. I love everything about crunch crust, a nice rich tomato sauce, and a thick layer of melted cheese. I have never tried Chicago style pizza before and when we had to rescue our friends from car troubles, Uno's was right there so we decided to try it out. \n\nOnly a 30 minute wait for a Saturday is pretty good for any restaurant in the Waterfront. We were seated at a booth in the bar area. The tables were clean and it was a big booth so the four of us were not squished. Only complaint, the bar was loud and when they did blended drinks you had to pause your conversation because the blenders were so loud. Good news, only happened twice!\n\nThe four of us decided to order two pizzas, the Pepperoni and the Farmers Market. I also ordered a Caesar salad because I needed more vegetables in my life.  \n\nThe salad. It was a big salad that I shared with my boyfriend. The croutons were huge and very crunchy. The Caesar dressing was not creamy, it was vinegar based and had a little bit of a \"bite\" to it as Chris kept on saying. I thought the bite had more to do with the vinegar than anything spicy, but who am I to say.  The lettuce was fresh and crunchy and they even added tomatoes like I requested. \n\nThe main dishes came out about 10 minutes later. I do not know what I was expecting but the pizzas were not as large as I was imagining. Two of the larger pizzas looked like personal pizzas to me. But!!!! I was soon to see that even if they are a bit smaller they were filled to perfection. \n\nThe Farmers Market pizza had caramelized onions, spinach, SUN DRIED AMAZING TOMATOES, regular tomatoes, eggplant, pesto as a sauce, and a blend of cheeses. The crust was perfection being so crisp and light that I stole Chris' extra from his plate. The sun dried tomatoes were great adding just enough sweetness to the pizza that I went looking for the slices with the most on them. It was a really really good pizza. We even ended up taking slices home with us! My eyes deceived me at first with the size! \n\nThen our friends told us that we had to try the cookie pizza. Cookie pizza? What sorcery is this? Matt, the one who suggested it said that we would not be disappointed. This cookie came out in a really large, bigger than our pizzas, dish. It had three scoops of icecream on it with a pile of whipped cream. WARM, right out of the oven, fresh cookie pizza. Oh sweet heavens, it was good. I am glad that I had enough room in my stomach to pile in that sweet goodness. \n\nChicago Pizza, I would absolutly try again. We had a bigger party and I think that might have flustered the waitresses just a bit. They forgot about our waters until the food came out, but were super apologetic when they did bring them. The food was ok. I ordered the crab cakes they were a bit heavy on the breading, so I would give them a rating of, \"eh\". My friend ordered a steak, asked for medium rare, and it came out...well done. He was too hungry to complain and just ate it. We might go back again, and this time maybe take a bit more time looking over the menu. New menu! Check it out! Girls night had to happen. We decided to go to Olive or Twist, because it was close and I did have a coupon. \n\nI was delighted with this bar/restaurant. I never knew that they had an upstairs! Upstairs they have couches and comfortable chairs with coffee tables in between them.  So much more comfortable than sitting on wooden or bar stools. And after a long day at work, being comfortable is really all that I am about. The music was slightly loud but still tolerable, and enjoyable because it was older rap music that we started to then sing and dance to (in our chairs!).\n\nWe all ordered food and drinks. I got the burger, which wasn't anything special, but I wasn't expecting the sun and the moon from it. My friends ordered the jerk chicken and the bean quesadilla. The jerk chicken was amazing. They had this jalapenos sauce on it, wooo hooo. It was so good. A perfect mix of sweet and spicy that was mouth watering. I kept on dipping my fries it in. Yummy!\n\nThe drinks were also perfect. I ordered the Wild Tea Mojito and the Pink Lemonade. Both of these drinks were refreshing and delicious. I just wanted to just go down the drink menu and check off all each and every one of those cocktails! I wanted to know if all of them could be as good as the two that I tried. \n\nIt was a great and comfortable experience for a bar. I will be going back soon!", "user_id": "DwXVdLxCHp9Uag-HjWgcnQ", "business_id": "6p9TlP2I8S4agxYMNFSDjg"}
{"text": "This place is quite big with a bar area, dining room area, and patio area. We decided to sit in the bar area so we could watch some football on one of the many TV's. They also have darts and two pool tables, which I really enjoy. When you are in the bar area you can see the beer being brewed through the window which is really cool. \n\nI ordered the hibiscus wheat beer and my friend ordered the white wheat, both of which are brewed by Rock Bottom. They both tasted delicious and were exactly what I needed for a hot day. My friend ordered the Fried chicken entree which came with mashed potatoes and of course she gave me a few bites since we always share. It was a pretty delicious meal, but the fried crust fell off a few pieces which I am not really a fan of. I ordered the Sante fe salad with grilled chicken not fried. The salad was okay I was expecting more flavors overall, but I didn't really get them. \n\nIt was a good experience and will most likely be back when I am around the waterfront area. I just moved into a new place in highland park and realize this place was right next door. I'm a huge fan of coffee and have never been quite satisfied with the taste ever since my trip to Italy(where there coffee is to die for). This place makes me happy with coffee again. I've also had lunch here and bagels for breakfast both very delicious. This is my new place! I've really enjoyed their pizza so far. I also ordered a chicken salad and it was tasty for a pizza take out place, nothing too fancy. I have only had the food at this place by delivery and it has always come before and hour has passed. The pizza always comes warm and ready to eat. Nothing to complain about. I did give it only 4 stars because there are a couple of other places that serve homemade ranch on the side which makes the pizza taste even extra delicious. This place is great for brunch on Sunday! The service is great and the food is delicious. I always leave stuffed and happy. The best hot dog I've had. Ever. I also have to say trying to decide which hot dog I wanted was by far one of the hardest decisions I have had to make (food-wise). Eventually, I got the chihuahua dog because it was out of the box and I wanted try something new. It comes with avocado spread, salsa, cheddar cheese, and jalapenos. The dog itself was perfectly crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside and really just the best I have had. The toppings were great and I was happy I gave it a try. My friend got the bacon and cheese dog. I was expecting bacon bit type bacon, but they were full strips of bacon that were perfectly crisp and the melted cheese was right on. I am certainly going to come back and try a new hot dog. I am very exciting to finally have a hot dog place that I know produces fantastic tasting hot dogs. \n\nI would definitely recommend you give this place a try. I went here after work around 4:30 without a reservation with my friend and it was the best time to come. Their happy hour is 4-6 on the weekdays and I was able to get $4 Cabernet that was really delicious. There were reservations on every table, but not until around 7 so we had time to enjoy ourselves. I got the jerk chicken sandwich on the recommendation of the server and I have to tell you it was delicious!! The chicken wasn't too dry and the jerk seasonings were perfect. I also got the sweet potato fries for a side and they were very good. I wish they were a little more crispy, but they were still good. We also ordered the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and I ordered the black manhattan drink to go along. Both were just amazing and exactly what I wanted for after a delicious, but not too filling dinner. Drinks were top notch.", "user_id": "SlKJNLm1SQdgaaKtqD--1w", "business_id": "McikHxxEqZ2X0joaRNKlaw"}
{"text": "Brunch = best in the burgh.  Hands down.  Best. eggs. ever. I am not even sure how the eggs can be that good.  I know what you are saying, \"They are eggs, Jessica.  Get a grip.\"  No.  I will not.  I cannot.  I want to stand on top of rooftops and shout my love for these eggs all over town.  \n\nJ, H and I went there a few Sundays ago.  We all got the same thing. When was the last time you went to a meal and all three people ordered the same thing.  It was that good.  The scallop breakfast is out of this world.  2 perfectly cooked scallops, scrambled eggs (the eggs!!!), the creamiest, tastiest grits in the world, buttery croissant and sausage, apples and butternut squash.  Don't think those things go together?  They do and are awesome!  J and I also both got orders of bacon cause no brunch is complete without bacon.  \n\nOur service was also great.  Nice hostess, awesome waiter.  All was perfect.  \n\nReally freaking good brunch.  Really.  Cannot say enough about those freaking eggs.  \n\nOh, but don't order an additional mimosa from the deal - they are $8 a piece which is a bit steep. Good, All-American bar food.  This is J and my go-to spot when we are in the mood for something good, reasonably priced and close to home.  We have been many times, but the last time was especially awesome. \n\nJ ordered the full slab of ribs which came with fresh-cut fries and cole slaw.  While there was a bit too much BBQ sauce on the ribs, they were cooked perfectly, fall off the bone good.  \n\nI was in the mood for a good beer of which they have plenty.  While I normally would order an Abita Purple Haze, I was talked into some shandy that was on special.  Thursday specials are micro-brews - which means that we should really go every Thursday.  But I am getting off track.  When the waitress told me that there were two shandies on tap, she offered to give me a taste of the one in which I wasn't familiar.  The beer that came out was big enough that I didn't really need to order a full glass, but it was good enough that I wanted several. \n\nWe decided to split an order of the pepper jack cheese bites which were served with unnecessary ranch dressing.  The bites were awesome - cheesy, not greasy and excellent breading.  I ordered the California Turkey Hoagie with a side spinach salad.  The spinach salad has feta cheese, walnuts, dried cranberries and warm bacon dressing - all in all, a delicious spinach salad with fresh, crunchy spinach.  The hoagie has fresh turkey - that is featured in several sandwiches and meals and always delicious - avocado, pico de gallo, swiss cheese and lettuce.  I would probably trade out the swiss for maybe pepper jack, but other than that - the sandwich is perfect.  \n\nI know that this place is not everyone's cup of tea, but for my husband and I, it's good food, good beer and decent service. \n\nThe one thing that for me stopped me from giving it 5 stars is that it is so freaking loud in there.  Apparently, this is the hangout for people that want to get really drunk and be really loud - even if there is no need for it.  You generally have to kind of yell over to be heard, but if you can get past it, the food is worth it. Go for the martinis, don't stick around for the food. \n\nI have been here several times for tiny tini Tuesdays - a weekly event that allows you to sample their colorful and delicious martini's in tiny glasses.  You order three at a time for a somewhat steep $12.  If you want variety though, this is not to be underestimated.  \n\nHowever, the food is always lacking.  I went on a lunch date here and decided to go for the grilled cheese and tomato basil soup as my stomach wasn't feeling up to anything more adventurous.  The grilled cheese was fine.  Nothing special.  The soup however had a thin drizzle of basil oil which when stirred in made the soup greasy and wholly unappetizing.  \n\nYour best bet is to head there after work for the martinis and then head around the corner to Six Penn for food.", "user_id": "3CxWftKJAqpsYRW0FqIWeg", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}
{"text": "Eh, this place was okay but it was sort of a weird crowd/overall experience for a Saturday night.\n\nBobby and I came here after dinner and sat up at the bar. Tip: if you sit behind the taps, no one will bother to acknowledge you exist. When we moved seats, we were finally asked what we would like to drink after waiting for 5+ minutes in our original seats. It wasn't all that busy, either. Most of the people sitting at the bar were a bit older than we were. It seems that Bar Louie is trying too hard to be trendy with the decor/neon blue lighting/extensive martini list. Maybe I'm just salty about the wait. I have a soft spot for this place -- probably because it is one of the first restaurants my fiance ever took me to, and he made a special night out of it. We've been back many times, for many occasions, and Casbah has never disappointed. Great wine, cocktails, food, service, and atmosphere. It can be a little more cramped on the inside, but it's never too loud. If you can sit outside, it feels nice and spacious. It's also very nice downstairs.\n\nThe valet parking is a huge plus in my book, especially in that area of Shadyside. The service is always prompt and never overbearing. \n\nThe last time we went, we had the sheep's milk gnudi and I'm pretty sure it was sent straight from heaven down on to our plate. I nearly fought my fiance for the last piece. He loves me so he let me have it. The swordfish was wonderful. The lamb is always great. The short rib ravioli melts in your mouth. I'd highly recommend any of those.\n\nThe dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding is worth unbuttoning your pants for...and if you like dessert wines, you'll be in heaven for sure! As if this place needs another glowing review!\n\nWhen I first moved to Pittsburgh, a local clued me in to the wonders of D's. She leaned forward and whispered, \"....yeah 'suchandsuchbar' is alright, but if you want the BEST beer selection in Pittsburgh with the friendliest staff, go to D's Six Pax and Dogz.\" \n\nShe proceeded to give me directions. Mind you, this was a total stranger. But I liked the mystique so obviously I jumped in my car and found D's (her directions were perfect.) \n\nWalking into the beer cave is an almost religious experience. What's this to my immediate left? Seasonal brews? Yes, I'll definitely have some of those. Trippel Belgians? Count me in. Beers brewed by monks? Of course. All the Dogfish Head and Rogue a girl could ever want? Double check. Giant bottles of Chimay? I must be dreaming. And if you thought things couldn't get any better, you're clearly not following along close enough-you get $1.00 off every bottle you take to go. \n\nBobby and I brought a friend here last night because he said he had never been. We stocked up on pumpkin beers and they even had Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin Ale which I can never seem to find anywhere. Our friend was in awe. The only downside I can possibly think of when it comes to D's is the magical time powers that seem to exist in the beer cave. I kid you not, I've sometimes found myself in the beer cave for over 45 minutes agonizing over crafting the perfect six pack. Of course, this isn't D's fault. I'm naturally indecisive. \n\nI love this place so good. Let me preface this review by saying that this is solely based on having a couple of drinks up at the bar. We didn't get to eat here (but would definitely return to try the food -- it all smelled delicious!)\n\nLast night, Bobby and I found ourselves downtown to check out all of the Christmas activities, and on our way we passed Olive Or Twist. Having never been here, Bobby I asked if I would like to stop for drinks on our way out to dinner so we decided to stop in.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was how warm and inviting the atmosphere was. You could tell it was a totally fun bar, and everyone seemed to be having a great time. We somehow managed to grab a seat up at the bar and ordered off their specialty martini list.\n\nIf you're feeling festive, definitely order the cake batter martini! It was AMAZING! The chocolate rim with sprinkles was a nice touch. I also ordered a regular vodka martini, which was excellent. \n\nThe only real drawback was that the service was really slow. It took awhile to get a drink menu, and then even longer to order. The drinks came up to us separately and it took a long time to make each. Despite the wait, we would still come back. The drinks themselves were excellent and I'm now very eager to try the food!", "user_id": "5s0YP_ZMshAYPb0VdSfukw", "business_id": "EoAY1JSVeJriBzId8lUQwQ"}
{"text": "I love Bar Louie's happy hour. $5 martini and half priced delicious veggie flatbread? Sign me up!  They also have a few other apps that  are part of the happy hour, but the flatbread is the one I usually get. \n\nThe melon martini is my current favorite, but most that I've tried have been good.\n\nI don't recommend the shrimp appetizer. And I'm not sure about some of the other food, but happy hour is 5/5 stars. The rest of the time, Bar Louie is probably a 3 star place. \n\nSo, if you're in the waterfront and are thinking of Bar Louie, go for the happy hour! I know this might sound weird, but: My favorite thing about Casbah is the bread. The bread is *apparently* from Eleven and it's amazing. If you go for dinner you get a crusty bread that is sliced thinly and served with butter AND (more importantly) a peppery soft cheese spread. I love this combination. If you go for brunch, they give you a little assortment of bread. I've always received a lime muffin and a biscuit, and last time I went there was a chocolate scone. I can't remember the third option on the visits before, but they have always been good. It also comes with a honey butter that is delicious. One time we even asked for more butter and muffins :) \n\nThe (other) food at Casbah is also very good. I've had a tomato bisque, cauliflower soup, swordfish, different pastas, multiple desserts, and the prix fixe brunch. Everything has been great. I don't think you can go wrong with the food. And, definitely get a dessert. The desserts have all been wonderful. \n\nThe service is also great and the decor is pretty. The patio is always warm on the winter and it feels more spacious than it does inside. Casbah is one of the restaurants on my \"definitely check it out\" list. D's is pretty awesome. The name is D's Six Pax & Dogs for a reason- they have a huge beer cave and a billion different hotdog combinations. The beer cave has: seasonals, local brews, imports, etc and a blast chiller thing that will chill your beer for you in seconds/minutes (like super fast). There is a hot dog list with different topping combinations, in which you can choose the type of dog you want: veggie, brat, beef hotdog, turkey dog, and even kielbasa, and put that dog into a CHIHUAHUA ( avocado, shredded cheddar, salsa, and jalape\u00f1os) or an ANGRY TIKI (Pineapple, bacon, hoison, and Double Dip sauce) or another suggested topping combination. If  the suggested dogs and topping combos don't float your boat you can choose whichever toppings you like from a giant toppings list.\nThe service is usually pretty fast and the servers are friendly and good at their jobs.\nThe only issue is that the place is often times busy, so occasionally you might have to wait a bit to get a seat. I not only expect to not like Olive or Twist, I also don't really *want* to like it. My one and only issue is that its kind of expensive. Martinis are all about $10, the entrees are all around $30, and unless you're going for happy hour, all appetizers are at least $10. I always start to wonder if it's really worth the cost, but honestly, I think it is.\n\nEvery time I've gone I've shared crab cakes. Before you judge the $27 price tag, just realize that they have the type of crab cakes that are actually made with real crab. These aren't $15 crab cakes that are half bread/filling, they are proper (and very large) crab cakes. This last visit we also split nachos and lobster mac n cheese. I've heard the buffalo chicken dip is good and every dessert I've tried has been great.\n\nIt's also a martini bar so you'd expect them to be great at them, and they are. Last visit I had the chocolate covered pretzel, but other memorable martinis include the birthday cake and strawberry short cake (please don't judge- these were actually enjoyed on my birthday.) And at although these drinks aren't always my favorite type of alcoholic beverage, they are soooo good. \n\nThe place is dark (in a good way) and has impeccable service. Or at least the server I've had both times, Jeff (per our receipt) is great at his job. He's exactly the kind of sever I would always want to have: nice, polite, and overall just generally good at his job with the timing of bringing food and checking on the table. \n\nI'd definitely visit Olive or Twist more regularly if they dropped their prices like 25%, but you get what you pay for and I'm willing to occasionally shell out the extra dough for a good meal with awesome service.", "user_id": "6xQnzz_TS0skNM1GIK8j8w", "business_id": "EoAY1JSVeJriBzId8lUQwQ"}
{"text": "My wife and I have eaten at Olive or twist before, and the experience was good. This time was not so good.\n  We were going to the Brit Floyd show at the Benedum, so i made 6:15 reservations for dinner at Olive or Twist. Traffic was a bit lighter than expected, so we ended up walking in at 6. No problem, we were seated right away. \n   Our server seemed a bit rushed, but had our drinks to us within about 10 minutes. Not bad, wife had a dark night martini and i had a porter that was on special. tasty glass of beer for only 3 bucks, i was happy. We ordered our dinners (crabcake sandwich for her, skirt steak sandwich for me), at around 6:15. Since the show didn't start until 8, we figured that we had plenty of time and could walk around a bit after dinner. We sat and talked and enjoyed our drinks, and waited for our food. And waited. And waited. And waited. Finally, at a few minutes after 7 a gentlemen in a suit came to our table, apologized for the delay, and told us our food would be coming shortly.  We had watched another table beside us get seated, get their food, and were preparing to leave and we hadnt even gotten our sandwiches yet. \n   Finally, at around 7:10, our food arrived. The server again apologized for the delay. I understand that things happen, and at no time did either of us get upset, but it really would have been a nice gesture to maybe comp us a drink or something. ANYTHING to acknowledge an unacceptable wait time. We didn't get anything, and that was a little disappointing.\n   We did eat quickly enough that we were not late for the show, but we never did get to take that walk.\n   The food was quite good, once we got it. I tipped the server generously, as i don't think this was her fault, but I am not sure if I will return. If you see my previous review of Olive or Twist, it was less than glowing. I was surprised when Brandon, the G.M. reached out to me concerning my bad experience. We exchanged a few emails and he apologized for our bad experience, took responsibility for it, and offered a gift card if i wished it, to give them another try. I accepted his gracious offer, and a gift card showed up in my mailbox a few days later.\n    While my wife and i enjoy eating out often (5-6 times a month or more), we don't dine in downtown Pittsburgh too often. We live almost an hours drive away, plus there are the parking issues. So , although i received the card last March, i didn't use it until Yesterday 3/12. \n   I bought my wife a 3 ballet subscription package for a Christmas gift. The first one was in February. I immediately thought of going to Olive or Twist for dinner prior to the show. I called and of course since it was the day before amateur night(Valentines day), there was no table available. \n   This month, i was able to get a table at our desired time. We got there a little early, and were seated immediately. Our server took our drink orders promptly. The martinis are expensive, but so are most martinis at most places. Hell, even a glass of draft beer is $6+ in a lot of places. Can't fault a business for charging what the traffic will bear.  \n   We ordered our entrees while enjoying our drinks and conversation. The place can be a bit loud, but not so much to prevent conversation. We have been to places where they have (so called) entertainment that eliminates any chance of having a conversation while dining. Even a single singer with a guitar feels the need to crank up the amp so that no one can talk. This was common at Siba on 228 by Cranberry. Hmm, they went out of business, didn't they?\n   Anyway, none of that at Olive or Twist, at least on the first floor. Our entrees arrived quickly, within 10-15 minutes  of us ordering them. My wife once again ordered the crab cake sandwich, which is mostly crab with a little breading. I guess at $17 you can say it's a bit pricey for a sandwich, but crab is not cheap, and you get a LOT of crab. It came with a house salad that my iceberg hating wife raved about. The only thing she didn't care for was that it came with Srircha ailoi. She does not like sriracha(i know, i love her anyway). She asked for it on the side to at least try it, but did not like it. Our server happily replaced it with some mayo at her request. I ordered off the special board, a Reuben sandwich. It was one of the best reubens i have had in a long time. Perfect ratio of corned beef to kraut to bread, very little dressing, and the corned beef was lean lean lean and lean! Delicious!\n    We chatted with our server a bit and told him of our previous visit and about Brandon reaching out to me. 5 minutes later Brandon stopped at our table, introduced himself, and thanked us for giving them another try. I in turn thanked him for the gift card and for his professional response to my less than stellar previous review. The way that Brandon handled that situation should be taught to everyone involved in running a restaurant. I can compare it to something that happened to me at a different restaurant. My wife and I used to LOVE The Brick house in Butler. Their food was always flavorful, interesting, and well prepared. Prices were reasonable, and service was usually good. It became our favorite restaurant, and over the course of several years we ate there often, took our grown sons and their families there, recommended it to many of our friends, and literally spent more there than any other restaurant we had ever eaten at. \n    One Saturday evening, we went to The Brick house for dinner. I will make a long story short(yea, i know too late). The food was awful. Horrible. My wifes dinner was almost inedible. My dinner was a little below average, but edible, so i ate it. The owner refused to speak to us, so we left, went home, and wrote a review\n   So what was his reaction to my review? He insisted the food was fine, called me boarish, insisted i was a freeloader that was just looking for a free meal, and that i was just an overall jerk of a customer.\n    My point in relating this story is this.The result of Larry G of the brick houses handling of the negative feedback is a customer lost forever, who is happy to share his experience with others. The result of Brandon's handling is a happy customer who will return to spend more money, and to share his positive experience with others. \n   Overall, there is a lot to like about Olive or Twist, and nothing of consequence to dislike. We will be back, and recommend it highly.", "user_id": "omFGuDc36gKJMYjH-3vHtQ", "business_id": "OxIeMVcop5oxBUWANi-1Rw"}
{"text": "I like this restaurant so much I had my wedding rehearsal dinner here.  (Both the families liked the food very much.)  Max's is the best German food in Pittsburgh -- actually, it's the best German food I've had outside of Germany, and I've definitely had worse meals in Germany as well.\n\nMax's is in a restored hotel, and the decor is very much in the Victorian style of the original hotel building.  The exception is the bar area that's good for happy hour or watching a game, or just having a beer -- that has a lot of neon and a jukebox.  But the bar area is also tasteful and pleasant to be in.  Max's has a full bar, but their real specialty is their excellent selection of German beers, both in bottles and on tap.\n\nI haven't met a wurst I didn't like, and they're pretty much all offered here.  The Braunschweiger sandwich is pretty delicious and unique in my experience, and the schnitzels are very delicious as well.  Another specialty is the kase spatzle (Spatzle noodles with smoked Gouda cheese -- a twist on mac and cheese that ensures that even a picky child will have something to enjoy here), but my two favorite menu picks here are the hassenpfeffer and the spinach salad with warm bacon dressing.  For sides, the red cabbage salad is my favorite, although the sauerkraut is also very good.  I don't care for the German potato salad, however -- I like the kind that has caraway seeds and vinegar, and is served cold, but Max's offers the kind that has an unidentifiable sauce and is served warm.  Some people like that style of potato salad though, and from what I can tell, Max's does a decent rendition of it.\n\nIf you're looking to reserve a room here for a banquet, you have a lot of options.  The basement \"Rathskellar\" is more bar-like in its atmosphere.  It would be a good place for some guys to have a birthday party or something.  For a rehearsal dinner or other formal event, one of the upstairs banquet rooms would be better.  Depending on the size of your group, you can arrange to have a buffet-style dinner, or individuals in the group can order directly off the regular dinner menu. Peanutz is a perfectly good neighborhood bar on East Ohio Street.  Their beer selection is adequate (basically all the American macro lagers, plus a few of the more widely-known craft beers, like Sierra Nevada), and their bar is stocked with the full gamut of booze (except ouzo).  Trish, the bartender, is a fantastic bartender with a hilariously sharp tongue.\n\nI haven't tried very many of the menu items, except for the chicken wings, which are a house specialty.  Everyone recommends the Four-Dip sauce, which is pretty good.  The Cajun rub is good too.\n\nDecor-wise, Peanutz is focused largely on Pittsburgh sports -- there are two large display cases with all sorts of sports memorabilia.  There's a handsome wooden bar in the front room, and a dining room off to the side. This is my favorite Italian market in Pittsburgh.  I buy food from here almost every week.  It doesn't have the crazy selection (or crazy crowd) of Penn Mac, but what it does have is a serviceable meat and cheese counter, a good range of olive oils, a few different brands of canned tomatoes, nice pepperoni, and a tiny little produce section which is heavy on the peppers.  I usually get my pasta from here rather than Penn Mac.  They have a few different choices of brand, all of them decent, and you don't have to fight a hundred out-of-towners if you want something.  The people are friendly, and if you stop in frequently, they remember you (Penn Mac and a lot of the other stores are just too crowded for the level of fussing-over that you'll get here).  \n\nJimmy (the guy with the cigar permanently ensconced in his mouth) also makes fabulous pepperoni rolls and sandwiches.  We like to eat lunch here as a break during our grocery shopping.  During the warmer seasons, you should sit at the outside tables and people-watch, because you will see and hear some truly hilarious stuff (this is the place where I heard the guy from Hermanowski's corner store chatting with the nun selling raffle tickets about another nun, Sister Dominica or something similar, who had won $50 on the scratch-off lotto and blown it all on more scratch-off tickets).  There's also an upstairs dining room for when it gets colder out, though.", "user_id": "SVd6Re9tpabo413b4LghYw", "business_id": "IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ"}
{"text": "I\"m a southerner, which doesn't qualify me as a born expert on cheese steak. But you don't need an advanced degree to know that this place puts out an absolutely delicious sandwich. I live 1100 miles away, but my first (and third, and fourth and fifth) stop when I go to Pittsburgh is always Rudy's. I usually avoid meat, cheese, and white carbs, but this definitely merits an exception. \n\nI have tried everything and like most all of it, but always get the steak and cheese, with egg. We never even heard of that back home. Get the smaller one unless you're sharing. I have to take part of the small to go, its enormous.\n\nI think they've been in the same place for 30 years and never heard about paint. Who cares what it looks like though, when its the best thing you ever put in your mouth? If you've been to Pittsburgh you know what to expect from a Primanti Sandwich. When I'm in the mood for them, they are fantastic. So when my mother and aunt came to visit da Burgh for the first time they were intensely curious about local restaurants, and this one came up. They thought it sounded fun and different, but since one is pescatarian leaning to the veg side, and the other is gluten intolerant, I really didn't think Primanti would be the best place to take them.\n\nWalking around down town we passed this one, and they wanted to sit down and give it a try. It was a beautiful day so we sat outside, which was really amazing. We were also amazed by our server. By the end of the meal, we were amazed she remembered to show up at work at all. In fact, its a distinct possiblility that she didn't ever work there, and was just confused and thought she was at the greek place across the square. You don't go to a sandwich shop to be blown away by your server, but there is a minimum standard you should aspire to, and she was far off that mark.\n\nShe took forever to get there, but it was no hardship sitting outside on a beautiful day with two of my favorite gals. We talked about the menu, Auntie decided to order anything with no bread, with some loaded fries. Mom wanted a sardine sandwich, but only if its the sardine filets, she doesn't like the kind with bones. She is not one to make a fuss, so figured cheese and egg would be fine too. \n\nWhen she came around for drinks, they got a water and a pop. I asked if she had PBR, and she replied she didn't know. Then continued to stand there, pen in hand, ready to write my drink order down. OK then, how about I just have a diet pop. Before she ran off, we ordered our meals. I asked her if the sardines have bones in them or not. She looked up from her note pad and looked at me with a look that said {insert foul insult here} and shrugged. A big, slow, deliberate shrug. Not a word. And then just stood there waiting to write my order down. After a good, long, awkward pause, she said \"I don't know.\"  All three of us just looked back at her, waiting, until eventually she sighed, held her pad down by her side, and with a big roll of the eyes, asked if I wanted her to check. Yes. Please do.\n\nSo then she ran off, and started running food out to tables all around and refilling drinks. Running the sandwiches, she would grab two or three tables at a time, and then put all the sandwiches down, sort of paw through them to see what was what, and leave theirs and take the rest. It was just strange.\n\nShe came back, and without looking up announced \"Don't matter, we are out of sardines anyways.\"Facepalm! From the length of time she had been inside the restaurant, I doubt she even asked. Mom, very uncomfortable that her question had become such a horrible inconvenience, asked for egg and cheese. Auntie ordered loaded fries to start, then her corned beef with no bread. The waitress told her she already gets fries with her sandwich, but she wanted them anyways. I got balogna, just because neither of them would ever guess what jumbo means.\n\nOf course, the order came out quickly, and wrong. Mine was fine the way it came, but not what I asked for. Mom was the same. Auntie was fine, but no loaded fries every showed up. Until we got the check, that's where they were. Getting those taken off was another huge inconvenience to our poor server. \n\nMy Aunt picked up lunch, and left the tip. I don't know what she left, but I think that probably amazed the server as much as her server amazed us. All in all, I reckon she enjoyed our lunch together just as much as we did.", "user_id": "vxPODovDtpgC8yiCwfxXBQ", "business_id": "IafkUjO5CiXAu9LfB4_Sgg"}
{"text": "Thank you so very very very much to the management Hallie.  She literally helped me with immediately with an error that was on my gift card.  \n\nAlso Hallie visited our table during our meal to see if everything and everybody was okay.\n\n Also our server, Aaron, was really helpful and sweet.  I am a very very picky eater.  I don't like onions, garlic, peppers, mushrooms, broccoli, rice, etc.  Aaron was awesome in his help as I selected my food.   \n\nVery rarely do  I eat dessert.  I love their  pineapple coconut ice cream.  There banana sprung rolls are good, but the ice cream is to die for.  The two come together. I am definitely the salt queen.  I literally salt everything from pizza, McDonalds French Fries (even though I know that they already have tons of salt on them).  I also salt ham and processed foods.   I always salt food before even tasting it.  Nothing is off limits when it comes to me and my salt shaker.\n\nWell when my beautiful meal arrived I asked my server for the salt.  None of the tables had salt or pepper shakers on them.  As my server went to get me the salt shaker, I took a bite of my potatoes.  Whoa!!!!!  They were extremely salty!!!!   For the first time in my life,  I didn't add any additional salt to my meal.  For me to say something is \"very\" salty.... It is very salty. \n\nBeing the salt queen,  I stll  was able to enjoy and love my meal.  I am almost guarantee that the average person would not have enjoyed this food..  My friend also tasted my meal and immediately noticed the heavy taste of salt.  However he never salts anything so something with one grain of salt on it, he will be about to tell.  \n\nIt really suprised me that such an upscaled restaurant would have this much salt added to their food.  I am sure that it was an error or something.  I have eaten here in the past and never experience so much salt.\n\nStill my meal \"for me\" was delicious.  For the first time in my life, I am glad that I did not add any salt to my meal.\n\n  I do love Casbah alot.  It is probably my second favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I don't know why but this McDonalds always managed to get my order wrong.  This is almost constant.   However there is a young assistant management who is extremely professional and friendly.

The tons of students just hang out, cussing or making a lot of noise.  They sit on tables and often just sit at your table.

{"text": "We (my fiance and I) went out for a pseudo-couples' date with our good friends, Sara and Thom, to Max's to introduce them to some of the most authentic German food in da Burgh. Where most people associate Hofbrauhaus with the ultimate German beer-hall experience, I prefer Max's for the quieter, less raucous environs. (At least when it's not Oktoberfest)\n\nWe'd been there once before and immediately fell in love with the place. I (still) keep raving about the Sausage and Cheese platter. They've got some good Gouda. The Potato Pockets (pierogies) were OK -- I'd take some Pierogies Plus or Forgotten Taste over Max's, but that's just me.\n\nThe spaetzel was to die for, however. It's like a German Mac n' Cheese. And boy, do I love me some Mac n' Cheese. It literally melts in your mouth with its' ooey-gooey-ness.\n\nDrink-wise, I tried their German lager and Thom tried the sampler. Thom is a beer enthusiast. For around eight bucks, you get a GOOD amount of beers to try -- they are not some dinky little shot glass samples, either. Thom had some trouble near the end finishing it...it was so much beer. Bob had a Captain and ginger-ale...in a king-size goblet. Goblets are the ONLY way to serve adult bevvies.\n\nFor dinner, I had the pork loin over an apple-raisin gravy/bread concoction. The pork loin was flavorful and tender, and quite delicious. Sara had the sauerbraten and seemed to enjoy it. Bob's burger was ginormous and looked extra tasty.\n\nWe finished it off with the Apple Fritters. Now, these fritters aren't for the faint of heart. And they aren't your average dinky small sized portions, either. You get two huge deep fried apple fritters, covered in vanilla ice cream. One person CANNOT eat the whole serving. You must, I repeat MUST share them. If you attempt to eat the whole plate yourself, you will have flavor explosion, followed by severe heartburn. But damn, are they GOOD.\n\nOur visit ended up totaling 2 hours. One thing, though...please fix your outdoor sign. Usually it shines out like a red and blue beacon in the night for people to find their way there, but on Wednesday, it was out. Driving there, I got confused on where it exactly was (but I had a general idea, as I had been there before.). I seriously enjoy shopping here. I cook Mexican-inspired meals a lot at home, and their shop carries some of the most authentic stuff for that purpose. Bonus: even though Reyna's is a specialty shop, they're not over-priced for a specialty shop.\n\nSome highlights: Their tortillas (corn and flour) are made fresh daily in the shop. Bring your kids; they will enjoy watching the tortillas trolley on the conveyor belt. There is a variety of flavors, too. I enjoy the garlic and herb, AND they are only 80 calories!\n\nAlso, if you love tortilla chips -- or if you need a large quantity for a party or football game -- get the huge bag of them. You will never go back to Tostitos once you've tried their chips. They are the real deal. And the large bag is a great buy -- you can buy 4 bags of the On The Border Brand at Sam's Club for the same price and still not have as many chips combined as what you get at Reyna's. I got a bag of supermarket chips after having theirs, and the supermarket chips were so bland and tasteless in comparison.\n\nTheir salsas and guacamoles are fresh and vanish within hours of opening them. Buy more than you think you need. It will disappear.\n\nI have yet to try the Taco Shack, but am curious to what they entail. I am sure they are worth it, and I know I will wonder why I waited so long to try them.\n\nAlso, the family that runs the shop are so nice and friendly! I have gotten in many conversations with them, and they are willing to help in any way they can. And they take pride in the products.

{"text": "I was SO ready to like this place!  Turns out, not so much.  It was okay.  No better than TGIFridays, but better than Eat n Park!  The deets.\n\nThe hubster and I were here on a Saturday evening after a show at the Improv so we were happy and in a good mood and ready to enjoy some good eats.  We ordered drinks.  He a wheat beer of their brewing, me my fave Bloody Mary with Absolut Peppar.  The hubster deemed the beer acceptable, but wouldn't go out of his way to come back just for another one....yes, he DID order another one \"just to be sure.\"  My Bloody sucked.  Watered down tomato juice with no discernible Peppar of any kind, let alone any other seasonings.  Even a good standard mix would have been better.  Our very efficient and friendly waitress took it back and watched while it was remade by the other bartender.  Nope, no better at all.  That went back and I went with a you-can't-screw-it-up Amaretto sour.  It was fine.\n\nHub ordered a Reuben - why, I'll never know because they simply never measure up to the gold standard of what used to be at the long-lamented Gazebo in Shadyside.  You younguns wouldn't have a clue of the establishment of which I speak.  He said this one was \"fine.\"  I had the Texas Fire steak with jalapeno butter which I enjoyed very much!  Packed a punch of heat and flavor, but the sides were uninspired.  Steamed veggies.  Any flavor was steamed out in the process - eh.  Cheddar mashed potatoes - there was cheddar in there?????  No way!\n\nThe tab was reasonable - we DID have a Living Social deal that took $30 off, so our check was for $12 and change, not including tip.  Not bad (even with the $15 cost of the LS Deal), but had we paid full price, it wouldn't have been worth the experience.  We'll hit the Improv again - we have before - but, we'll head somewhere else afterwards. I am writing this from the standpoint of someone who can't eat real Chinese food because of gluten issues. That said, I am loving me some gluten-free Chinese food here! If the gf issue didn't exist, though, why bother when you can get real, honest, non-chain GREAT Chinese so many wonderful places in the Burgh?!  But average Chinese is better than NO Chinese if gluten is an issue so thank you Mr. Chang! I remember when this place was the Pittsburgh Fish Market, when it was freshly opened and a gem in downtown dining.  And I should remember it!  It hasn't changed a whit in all this time.  Oh, wait....that big white upside down bowl of Jello cubes hanging from the ceiling is gone.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, the green curry black grouper was one of the best fish dishes I've had in a long time.  The grouper was cooked perfectly, kissed with a sweet and spicy green curry paste, nestled atop a pile of garlicky spinach and accompanied by good steamed rice to soak up all the sauces.  The dish was perfection.  Had the Original Fish Market been judged on food alone, the rating would have been 4.5 stars for sure.  Even the waiter was spot on!\n\nUnfortunately, the surroundings are dark and dated and dusty.  Downtown dining is on the upswing and if OFM wants to stay in the downtown running, it needs to up it's game.  Is anybody at OFM listening? \"Jalapeno tostadas...yum!\" That was a tip I shared a while back, let me go just a little deeper. That Hot sauce you found, loved and could never locate again? Reyna's has it. Biggest hot sauce collection in town. The same goes for BBQ sauces, any Latin ingredient you can think of, salsas out the wazoo, HANDMADE tortillas and tortilla chips so good they supply the best Mexican restaurants in Pittsburgh, fresh salsas, scorpion lollipops (for your wild, still sweet self), loose beans, herbs and all sorts of goodies in bins in the back....including dried hibiscus flowers that I make my mango hibiscus daiquiris with!\n\nWhatever you need, Reyna's has it. If they don't, ask...they do their best to get it! And don't miss the taco stand outside or the restaurant downstairs.

{"text": "The Huddle is foolishly cheap.  It's cash only.  You'll meet a lot of Yinzers here.  It's highly entertaining to sit at the bar and listen to the conversations occurring around you.  The average age is probably 45, but it's well interspersed with younger people, hipsters, and unpretentious people that want a cheap beer.  If you live in the area, and you haven't been here yet, you should definitely swing through.  \n\nMost bottles of beer here are $2.  Don't expect to order any micros, but there's a solid list of macros available.  Buckets are a popular option.  \n\nI've also eaten here, and while I don't remember what I got, I do know that it was cheap, and it was well worth the $6 or so I spent on the meal.  \n\nLast but definitely not least...there's free fresh popcorn in the back.  Boom. Happy hour specials are $1 off drafts and half-priced appetizers.\nTry the calamari, it's got a funky sauce but really tasty.\n\nOlive or Twist is usually really crowded for HH on Fridays, which is when my work crew usually rolls in.  I've only been here once during a non-friday HH, and it was much more enjoyable.  The food has been hit-or-miss, but I have generally been impressed with the apps.  \n\nI gave this place three stars because of several things.  I've tried a lot of beers here, but I often get them with a glass of 'funk.'  They need to clean their lines more often to get rid of that taste, and drop the price a bit; this is Pittsburgh, not Boston.  Martinis have been hit-or-miss; they've done an excellent job on the dirty Ketel One, but some of the girls have gotten foo-foo drinks that have been undrinkable. Subway calls their line folks \"sandwich artists.\"  If those people are considered artists, then the cooks at Primanti Bros are friggin' Picasso.  \nIf you've never sat by the grill, you should, just to see them in action.  On a busy lunch day, it's not uncommon for them to have 15 things going at once, and they keep track of what's what via...broken french fries.  I've never seen or heard them get anything wrong, either!  While I wouldn't call them chefs, as the menu at the end of the day is simple, they definitely have a solid skill set at the griddle.\n\nIf you've never been to Primaniti's, here are a few tips from a seasoned veteran.  \nTip 1:  Always get fried egg.  Always.  On everything.  \nTip 2:  Pick up a bottle of hot sauce and sploosh it on the fries...those of you complaining about bland fries definitely need to try the hot sauce technique, as it makes a definite difference.  \nTip 3: The \"cheesesteak\" sucks and is a travesty that people are encouraged to order this abomination, as compared to many other items of deliciousness on the menu. \nTip 4: I'm a  big fan of capicola (with egg) and the colossal fish.  The fish is huge, and you will feel like a fat kid if you finish it.  \nTip 5: A 23oz  \"Iron\" is only like $4.  Get one and talk like a Yinzer for a complete experience.\n\nThe Market Square location is just as good as the original in the Strip.  Oakland is meh, Southside comes up third in my book.  I haven't been to others.  If you're coming in from out of town though, any of them will fit the ill. Went to Rolands for lunch of a Sunday.  Around 30 beers on draft, but mostly the usual beers; only a few micros.\n\nThe actual menus themselves need updating; they're something you'd see in a crappy diner....photocopies stuffed into clear plastic film.  \n\nWe both got salads; one tuna & one salmon.  Huge pieces of fish that were of decent quality.  The upstairs has a cool balcony to hang out on in the summer.  It's a cool place in strip; I'd recommend stopping by and checking it out.", "user_id": "hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w", "business_id": "wan0X-oHpLgGTPXqaICZCw"}

I think the low point was someone ordered a steak medium rare (for $38).  What came out was a well done and COLD piece of meat.  It looked like a hockey puck. \n\nWhen he sent it back, no apology...and no change in the bill.  I at least expected a manager or someone to come out and apologize and say \"We've taken it off the bill\" or SOMETHING.  Nope.  He sat there watching the rest of us finish our entrees before his replacement steak arrived.\n\nThe rest of the entrees were good and I would go back.  But probably with lowered expectations. One in our party summed it all up:  \"When you're paying these prices, you should expect better service.\"\n\nThe food was good.  I had a sashimi platter with some additional pieces, which was perfectly average.  You can get the same thing around the corner at Sushi Kim...and I think the quality is a bit better and the price lower.\n\nAnother in our party had the rib eye.  It was cooked well and he liked it.  For dessert the cheesecake was good, although the blueberries were clearly from frozen (unacceptable in July when they're in season).\n\nI had to sit and wait 5 minutes after my food was brought out before I could flag down a server to ask for some chopsticks and soy sauce.\n\nIt's not that the servers aren't working...it's that they're spread too thin.  Understaffed.  All working hard, but covering too many tables.\n\nLong story short, I won't go back.  Walk over one block and go to Eleven!  Same price, better food and service. I hesitate to even write this review because technically we didn't eat here.  But after reading the other reviews, I thought \"Eh, what the hell.\"\n\nWe came in and were seated at 5:45pm for desserts/drinks.   By 6:05, we still hadn't seen our waitress.  We decided it wasn't worth it and just left.\n\nI did eat here a month ago, and yes -- the fried fish was fried to the point where it was beyond greasy.  And then to pay around $20 for that?  LOL.

{"text": "First I'll start off with the homemade beer.  Nothing spectacular, but it has flavor and is very reasonably priced, as is the menu.  I went with the potato pancake Reuben.  HOLY CRAP.  Probably the most filling meal I've ever ate, but it was worth it.  My boyfriend was pretty happy he got to finish my leftovers.  The German potato salad I had for my side was equally as good.  It had a bit of a bite to it, which I really liked.  I also had to try my boyfriends meal.  He went with one of the wursts, but the exact name is escaping me.  It was made with veal, and was so light and tender - YUM.  That will be my meal when we return.  I can't believe it took me so long to eat here! This was my boyfriend's choice for his birthday dinner. We had both heard great things, plus we love BYOB spots. \nI'll start with saying that the service was great. Our waitress made us feel like regulars that have been frequenting the restaurant for years. \nWe both ordered specials. They were different preparations of fish. Both were really good. Everything we tasted was wonderful. \nThe downfall was when we got the check. The specials were both $30+. They were good - but not that good! You can find great Italian food elsewhere and skip the $100 tab. Probably my favorite breakfast spot in the city.  Yes, Pamela's hot cakes are amazing, but this place has the best all-around breakfast for sure.\nBest thing to do is get there right when they open.  Don't be surprised if there isn't already a crowd standing outside.  If you do have to wait for a table, be patient, it's totally worth it.  Try the hotcakes.  My favorite is the pumpkin flavor they have end of summer/fall.  They're SO fluffy and delicious. Four stars for the pizza!\nGreat crust.  I usually don't eat the crust, but I couldn't let this go to waste.  We ordered the Leopold.  In the description, it noted a \"hint\" of anchovy.  It ended up being more than a hint, which was welcomed by my boyfriend and myself.  \nWe'll be back when we're in the area.  I see this being a regular spot after our rounds of golf at Mt. Lebanon GC. The only reason this gets three stars instead of two is because of the Lobster roll.  Since working in NYC for a few months, I've been on the prowl for a decent Lobster roll in Pittsburgh.  This particular roll is served hot, which isn't what I'm used to.  I was totally skeptical; however, it turned out to be pretty good.  I think the roll, which I believe is from Mancini's, was really good.  The only downfall is that the roll is served with a MOUNTAIN of icky fries.  No thanks.\n\nThe service was borderline terrible.  We sat at the bar, and were ignored for about 15 minutes when we were trying to order.  It wasn't even busy!  The bartender saw us with menus and knew we were getting dinner, but decided the Pens game was more important.  He wasn't helpful or pleasant either.  \n\nThe only reason I'd come back is for the roll.  Besides that, I'd pick anywhere else in the Strip. I've tried and tried to give this place a chance.  It's upsets me that an establishment like this can exist among so many great places in the Strip.  I end up at Roland's because my boyfriend's co-workers always want to go there for happy hour.  They have a special on oysters and shrimp cocktail, so I ordered those.  The oysters were absolutely disgusting.  They were not fresh, or cleaned very well.  My fingers ended up getting all dirty and they had a gross, gritty taste to them.  They threw the POORLY deveined shrimp on ice, and it ended up soggy.  I had to pick the veins out myself, and after about two I lost my appetite.  As always, the service was terrible.  Next time I'm dragged to a happy hour there, I'll order water.  Never again will I spend money in this place.  YUCK!", "user_id": "0vCEI3ZJF_gXgWHpcR7WtA", "business_id": "IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ"}
{"text": "After having a few 'less than memorable' trips to D&B in years past, my wife and I  decided to go back for a Pittsburgh Happy Hour Anniversary party this past Thursday.  Pgh Happy Hour is a facebook group of friends that like to check out new 'watering holes' every thursday and it's run by a guy that seems to party 24/7 while still holding down a very lucrative full time job.  \n\nAnyway- Pgh HH was celebrating an anniversary and chose D&B for the location.  The D&B staff set up the back 'pool room' with complimentary,  enormous spread of appetizers with dips and kept refilling them when they got low.  Our server, Carla, was very attentive and friendly- making sure we were aware of the specials and checking back often when our glasses got to the half way point.  The other server back there was working equally as hard but I never got the chance to get her name.  \n\nI had been here one other time for an organized happy hour for a past employer and remember very similar service but I never got the chance to give them any credit.  I think D&B is an awesome place when you need some space for your next event. Chilling with Kimberly Vasil, Mikey & Big Bob for the 96.1 Kiss FM Listener Appreciation Party.  Kiss really knows how to throw a bash- $10 power cards, free t-shirts, megaphones & basketballs, appetizers & n/a beverages...  Apps are flowing & delicious, everybody is happy...  Nice Bash Kiss FM...! For pick-up or delivery, this place has some damn good Chinese food!  I'm going to keep it short & sweet- They are QUICK (we've played 'delivery games' and ordered Chinese & pizza at the same time and they have never been beat).  The prices are VERY REASONABLE- for the amount & portions you get.  The QUALITY & TASTE is as delicious as I've ever tasted for Chinese.  Try it for yourself and come back to review- I'll bet you'll love it too!\n\nBtw- THEY DO NOT SMOKE.  There's a review on here that 'they smoke around the food' but I've never seen it.  I even asked them if they smoked and they said no.  I have no idea why someone would lie about that other than to drive business to another place.  So why did you lie Ty G.?  Hmm...? Awesome bartender- ask for Michelle... Good Happy Hour specials- half price drafts and Apps from 5-7... Delicious looking food coming out of the kitchen...  Come here and enjoy the quiet, cool, relaxing ambiance... (Before the Pirates come back to town!)... Went to the Green Tree Olive Garden for their Buy One-Take One special.  Their Salads and breadsticks are the only real reason to go there anymore...!  All of their menu items are frozen, sitting in a freezer until you order them, then they're pulled out, microwaved and served.  I mean- if I wanted to eat microwaved food- I'd go to the freezer section of my grocery store and shop there.  Seriously- if you want good breadsticks & salad- go here... but that's the only reason.  I'd rather take the extra time & make real pasta at home, using my own sauce... This place is the deli you have always dreamed about.  The sights, the smells, the tastes...  Delicious!  The fresh bread is amazing, the stuffed pizzelle's are very good and my wife thinks they have the best cannoli's in Pittsburgh.  Stop in & talk to Jimmy and ask him about Stella the parrot.  This place is a 'must-see' every time we're in the strip. Stopped in last night because we wanted to 'step out' of our usual places on Carson St.  The place was rather busy and was pleasantly warm on a cold Saturday night.  We found seats at the bar and a friendly bartender greeted us and took our drink order.  The drafts arrived right away and we requested menu's...  \n\nWe ordered 2 shrimp cocktails and a calamari.  The shrimp arrived within 5 minutes and came with a small bowl of cocktail sauce with a dollop of horseradish on top.  I mixed mine as I love horseradish but my friend would have preferred it on the side or in another bowl as he isn't a fan.  The shrimp were big and fresh and delicious.  I mean- can you really mess up cold shrimp...?  The calamari took over a half hour to arrive.  It was pleasing to the eye and smelled delicious.  It had grilled onions & peppers on it with a slight spice dusted on top.  I thought it was delicious but my wife wasn't digging it.  She thought it was overcooked & rubbery.  Our friend isn't a fan of calamari so we didn't have a 3rd opinion to be the deciding factor...\n\nThen things went south...\nMy wife went into the ladies room and came out with a straight up disgusted look on her face.  I saw her stop a waitress and after the 'chat' the waitress turned away and rolled her eyes.  Well, my wife said the bathroom was disgusting- Toilet paper & paper towels all over the floor, 5 stalls with only a half roll of toilet paper to be shared between all 5, no paper towels to dry your hands off after you washed them.  Does the employees have a separate washroom to use or do they use this one also and just don't notice???  The health dept signs say \"Employees must wash & dry hands with soap & hot water\".  Then I visited the Men's room and found almost the same thing- paper all over the floor in the stalls, I didn't notice if they had tp in there, and no paper towels to dry your hands with.  \n\nTo us- the bathrooms must be clean & well stocked or we wonder what the kitchen & other 'back of house' areas look like.  If the bathrooms are in this much need of attention- the kitchen must be worse...  \n\nWe paid our tab and left...", "user_id": "Qs5dcst13DnQJwaBcR4VGg", "business_id": "sbW8qHJgzEIH42B0S-3New"}
{"text": "They don't deliver to me anymore, moved to Lawrenceville.  However, their pizza is good, not too greasy, not too dry.  Nice balance with the sauce cheese and toppings.  They have awesome house rolls, I'm partial to the spinache and feta house rolls.  They are SO delicious.  Pretty cheap.  The delivery time is kind of long, but they are open late, and I love that. We went here on a double date of sorts.  My boyfriend and I and my sister and her fiance.  \nWe started with cocktails and a cheese plate.\nMy sister ordered the Watermelon Fizz (Gin drink) and it was super tasty.  My boyfriend ordered the Berry Bourbon, I was jealous, it was divine. I ordered the Boyd and Basil (vodka drink) and it was lovely.  5 stars for beverages done right.\nThe cheese plate was wonderful, it came with 3 different spreads and 5 different cheese, and some prosciutto.  A+!\nThey gave us extra bread and the salted butter and their yogurt butter.  It was amazing and we gobbled it all up.\nWe all ordered the Arugala salad -- it was gorgeous. \n(Arugula, house-made pancetta, crimini mushrooms, potatoes, Riverview Farms goat cheese, pancetta vinaigrette )\nI ordered the Roasted Gerber Farms Chicken (whole grain mustard grits,greens, fresno peppers, fava & preserved lemon pesto, thyme jus), my sister got the Ricotta Cavatelli,\n(house-made fennel sausage, spinach,crushed tomatoes, ricotta), her fiance ordered the Grilled Swordfish(Swiss chard, roasted tomato, garlic, chilies, caper, crispy polenta, espelette, Meyer lemon vinaigrette), my boyfriend got the Long Island Duck (roasted breast, braised leg, gnocchi, spinach, lavender, rhubarb, duck jus)  \\\n\nMy chicken was good, not great and a little flavorless. the mustard grits were superb, the lemon pesto kind of tasted like lemon pledge and really over powered the whole dish, which was really disappointing.\nMy sister ADORES their cavatelli, but this time... it came out cold. She is not one to complain and ate it regardless.\nHer fiance's swordfish was perfectly prepared and tasted wonderful. \nMy boyfriends duck was cooked to perfection and all the sides were incredible (so he says). \nWhen desert rolled around I was not interested as I was already so full from the dinner. \nMy sister ordered a glass off prosecco and Chocolate S'more Cake\n(toasted marshmallow, salted caramel ice cream,graham crumb) which was deadly! I tried a small bite but since I am not a sweets person it was overpoweringly chocolatey. Her fiance got the Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me Brul\u00e9e\n(rhubarb chiboust, poached rhubarb, shortbread cookie) which he enjoyed very much. The rest of us opted for coffee's and watching them eat.\n\nTheir wine selection is dreamy, their cocktails are perfection in a glass, and their food is absolutely delectable.\n\nI would go back to Casbah at the drop of a hat but I was not completely floored or blown away by any dish. Here's a little story... \nThe first time I ate here was with 3 friends right after the Pens won the Stanley cup this last time. All of us got violently ill despite eating different things.  The bathrooms were atrocious. There was toilet paper everywhere. There were some bugs in the ladies room.  This was mid-day and NOT the southside so I found it a bit surprising. \nThe last few times I've eaten here have been in the last 2 years and everytime I find the food and environment to be mediocre.  It's never horrible. Hasn't made me sick, again.  It's just sub par.  My s.o. likes the lobster roll here and says it's great.  I don't eat seafood often so I wouldn't know. I've had the white pizza with basil and it was pretty good.  Good cheese to crust ratio for sure.\nI wouldn't say not to go here, but if you're looking to get something delicious and exciting I'd suggest finding something else in the strip.", "user_id": "57tPrvg7i2R3QjsxTiY-Xg", "business_id": "T49ZvBa6mD4xHSmjHe-ArA"}
{"text": "I have no reason to give this place less than 5 stars!  I've been here before a few times, but this past Friday we had birthday reservations for my girlfriend's 25th at 8pm.  I got there and the place was almost empty! Quite a change from other times I've been in.  I didn't mind it though, we had a great dinner and were able to hear each other speak.\n\nWe started with the calamari.  It was fried and tossed in a sweet, Asian flavored sauce.  It was amazing!  Cooked well and not your typical breading.\n\nI ordered their red pepper and gouda soup and the steak salad with chicken instead.  Chicken was tender and cooked well.  It had a lot of flavor and the ranch was excellent.  Others at the table had the steak sandwich, grilled cheese and soup, and steak salad.  All received rave reviews.\n\nThe real reason to come here, though, is for their martinis!  I haven't had a drink here I didn't like.  This past weekend I had the strawberry shortcake martini (long week!) and it tasted like a milkshake.  It was frothy and the rim of the glass had a brown sugar (?) crushed graham cracker.  Other drinks I've tried here range from cosmo's to caramel apple and other martinis (OMG.), the grapefruit mimosa-type drink, riesling and vodka diet cokes.  Everything has been well-executed, not watered down and served promptly.  It is clean inside and has a swanky, open upstairs with couches, high tops, televisions and a large bar.\n\nA really fun and different place to go either for food or just drinks or both! I've been here before but last night will probably be the last time I ever have any type of desire to eat their food. My boyfriend and I were meeting my parents for dinner and everywhere we tried was booked for reservation only on Pitts graduation weekend. We ended up and Roland's and were seated within 5 minutes.  Our waitress was a combination of ditzy, snobby and bored. She was awkward and uncomfortable every time she came to the table. She is not a good candidate to be in the service industry, in my opinion. \n\nWe ordered the lobster roll sliders to start. There were 4 of us and they brought out three. No big deal- mom and I will split one....but the waitress only brought three plates. I ordered the Maryland crab soup (specified first) and hot lobster Caesar salad. My salad came out shortly after the appetizer sliders. I sat for 15 minutes without touching the salad as to wait for the rest of everyone to get their food. Finally it was delivered. My dad and boyfriend had the seafood stew which they said was good and my mom had the pasta di mare (she said it was just ok. Lacking flavor) and a salad (which she was never given and didn't realize until after we left).  No soup for me apparently. I requested the waitress please bring it out. She was unapologetic. \n\nWhen I finally got to dive into my hot lobster (now cold lobster) caesar, I realized it was just lettuce, a little cheese and the lobster. At this point I was so irritated with everything I didn't even care - nor was I surprised at the quality of my dish given everything leading up to it.  The lobster was good and there was a good bit of it plus the Caesar dressing which I always like. The Maryland crab soup tasted like chunky tomato marinara sauce and I gave it to my boyfriend to go home and use on his own homemade seafood pasta dish. My mom was disgusted by the clams in her dish and it was suggested that they were probably frozen. \n\nDo yourself a favor and go down the street to luke wholeys Alaskan grill where you get much better quality seafood for the same price.

{"text": "It's basically the only Chicago style pizza in the Burgh. Not having had authentic Chicago style pizza, I don't know how this chain's pizza compares. However, the pizza is decent. The crust is thick and buttery and the toppings are abundant. However, don't be fooled, they serve up much more than pizza and sometimes, it's nice to have that variety when you're coming with a large party and when not everyone wants pizza. \n\nI like the versatility here with the varied menu. Sometimes, I don't even come here for the pizza. While the pizza is definitely the star of the show, their steak is also pretty tasty as are the sandwiches. \n\nThe food is enjoyable but the main reason why this is a go-to for me and my friends is because the service is usually very quick here. There rarely is a wait and the wait staff get us in and out right in time to make it to a movie. With food being rather consistent, it's hard to go anywhere else and chance the long wait times. I've been coming to Sushi 3 since high school and it's always been a local go-to for good sushi. The quality of the food and service have always been consistent every time I have stopped in. \n\nI've tried a number of their rolls and none have disappointed. The pricing seems to be pretty average as far as sushi goes. The space is pretty small with maybe five booths and a few seats at the sushi bar. But it seems that this place gets a lot of takeout orders because every time I'm in, there are plenty of people coming and going. Personally, I like dining in because it's so quiet and peaceful. In addition to fresh and flavorful sushi, the service is always fast. They usually have our food out to us in no time at all.\n\nUnfortunately I don't live nearby anymore so I don't get to stop in quite as often. But when I'm in the mood for sushi in the South Hills area, Sushi 3 is my top choice. I've been coming here for years and you can't go wrong with anything from their menu. When I heard they were under new management, I was sad, hoping that the quality of the food wouldn't change. But good news! The food is still amazing! My favorites are the eggs benedict, Lori's stuffed French toast and any of the hot cakes. But like I said, you can't go wrong with anything you order. Hands down, the best place for weekend brunch. So many people have told me how amazing the hoagies are here and I can't believe it took me this long to finally give it a try! \n\nTriangle is not a fancy establishment but I totally appreciate that. Their specialty is hoagies and they have a number of sizes and meats. They're famous for the battleship but since we were only feeding two people, I got the torpedo and the hubby got the destroyer size of the cheese steak. The sandwiches were loaded with meat and the oil and vinegar dressing added such a nice flavor. I can definitely see why the hoagies here are famous and literally everyone I know knows about this diamond in the rough. \n\nNext time you're looking to feed a crowd, skip the sandwich ring and get a battleship or even super battleship. Meh. Roland's seems like it would be a signature restaurant of the strip but it didn't quite live up to the reputation it has for good seafood. More like a grease fest. I ordered the lobster roll and the hubby ordered fish tacos. I can't say any of it blew me away, but it was okay. However, for the quality of seafood you're getting, I think the pricing is just too high. Especially when you're paying for mostly grease. The portions look huge but you're paying for mostly fries.", "user_id": "BCDRMjjM07Bp7Du2iZpg9w", "business_id": "6p9TlP2I8S4agxYMNFSDjg"}
{"text": "Who would have thought that a vegan-friendly hipster restaurant would be one of the best places in Pittsburgh to feed a hangover? \n\nSeriously, go hungover, and you will be in love. Get a super-stuffed burrito. They put mashed potatoes in burritos along with hearty beans, scrambled eggs and cheese and yummy salsa. Your stomach will thank you. \n\nWhile you're waiting, have some coffee. At under $10 for a VERY filling burrito and a bottomless cup of coffee, I thought it was a great deal. \n\nIn addition to their regular menu, they also have daily specials and themed brunches. I can't wait to go back and try other things on the menu. It's great to have a full-service restaurant where you can get oodles of vegetarian items. For convenient take-out chinese, this place is the bomb. My judge of Chinese take-out depends on the quality of their hot & sour soup. This soup is lovely with big chunks of tofu and little mushrooms floating throughout it - though I'd prefer some more exotic mushrooms thrown in too. \n\nOverall, this place has quick service and throws in lots of big chunks of fresh vegetables. When's the last time you had vegetable fried rice with chunks of bell pepper, broccoli, pea pods, and onion. The Kung Pao chicken could be spicier but next time I'll ask. \n\nThe Allentown neighborhood of  No. 1 China House is its major detractor. I'd be concerned about safety heading up there at night. For delivery, however, you'll get all your basics quickly and be happy with your order. This is an unassuming place on the North Side - close to the Mattress Factory. But walking in the door, you are hit with a wall of smokiness (the rib kind), and you know this is a serious place. The owner, Mr Wilson, is a quiet man of few words. You have 2 choices - ribs or chicken. Ribs come in small plate, large plate, or full rack. Then you can add on sides and soda at about $1 each. \n\nI went with a small group, and we filled ourselves silly on ribs and sides. \nVery good sauces. The small plate of ribs is *very* filling for lunch. \n\nAs others have said, the decor is nothing to write home about. But there are a few tables. Most of the business when we were there was take-out, which I will definitely be returning to do. This is a happening joint for happy hour and beyond. I've walked by the huge windows while downtown before and been amazed at how many people were drinking it up inside. Friday night, I finally made it inside. \n\nI was disappointed that they used \"mojito mix\" for their seemingly very popular mojito - but at least they had freshly mashed mint. The martinis are generous, but you pay the price for them. Enjoy your measly $1 off at happy hour during the week, but I don't blame them. Why have a better happy hour when you're already making money hand over fist? \n\nThis is a fun place to hang out but expect to spend lots of money if you stick around. The atmosphere is probably the best for a downtown bar, but the crowd is surely on the older side. \n\nUnfortunately, they still allow smoking, but the place is big and airy enough that it's not so much an issue.\n\nOverall, I will definitely be heading back to Bossa Nova on another night - it has a very nice atmosphere. But I'll be sticking to one drink at a time. This place is the ultimate two star. If you have a craving for a cheap gyro downtown at night in Pittsburgh, this is the place to go. Unfortunately, Mike & Tony's closes by 6pm. You won't get good service, you will get frozen french fries tossed in the deep fryer served in disappointingly small portions. You will have to scrounge around for a bottle of ketchup and hot sauce. However, the gyro meat is freshly cut off the spit, and the over-stuffed sandwich is a good deal at $4.30. \n\nOverall, there aren't that many cheap places open at night downtown, so go here if you're stranded and can't stand the thought of another Sammy's corned beef sandwich. Otherwise, hold out for one of downtown's great lunch spots.", "user_id": "Iseb_IvqOEfY_p1m9OwTrw", "business_id": "PzG0XmAmtXFs6Fdnubf41g"}
{"text": "Sometimes you just don't need a fancy shmancy over-priced frilly frittata-ed brunch to get the job done. Sometimes you just want a greasy spoon diner that knows how to fry up some good breakfast.\n\nI love this place. The booths are falling apart, the waitresses aren't overly nice, and it's chaotic. But I can design my perfect breakfast because they serve half waffles and single French toasts! I hate having to choose between sweet and savory breakfast and, at Gab & Eat, you don't have to. Everything I've eaten here has been very good. \nWaffles = gooood. \nSausage Patties= gooood. \nMixed grill = gooooood. \nPepper, onion, sausage, cheese, and potato omelet = so so so good. \n\nYou really can't go wrong here. It's a great place for cheap eats! Making your way in the world today takes everything you've got.\nTaking a break from all your worries, sure would help a lot.\nWouldn't you like to get away?\n\nYea yea- it's nice to go where everybody knows your name, but you know what's even better? A server who knows your drink order and weekly wing order.\n\nTheir wings are the best in the city. Now I like a 20 flavor wing sauce list as much as the next guy, but trust that you don't need all of those options. At The Huddle you get 2 sauce choices and you can have those choices wet or tanned. BBQ tanned in my go-to. They slather on that sweet BBQ and then bake it into the wings. The result are wings with crispy, sticky skin and tender, juicy meat. \n\nThe Huddle isn't trying to be fancy or unique. They are serving straight up bar food, but it's pretty good bar food. Also, don't expect 5 star service (but the wings make up for it).\n\nAside from the wings, I'm a huge fan of their Reuben and their monstrous grilled cheese. Pizza is surprisingly good as well! We usually have a party of 6 on wing night and their pizza is the perfect appetizer to split among the table.\n\nCash only! This place is less than mediocre. Visited on a Friday night and it was pretty crowded. We requested a high top near the bar and the hostess was very accommodating. \n\nThe food was \"meh\". The clam chowder was just ok. I was excited for the lobster/artichoke pizza, but it was absolutely tasteless! Like, I was shocked by how much it tasted like nothing. I ended up slathering my clam chowder all over the pizza in an attempt to kick up the flavor. The pizza crust was good -thin and chewy just like I prefer. We also ordered the lobster roll sliders and the best thing about that dish was the Mancini bread.  Not worth the bucks. \n\nThe service was slow-mo, but as I mentioned it was a crowded Friday night so it didn't bother me much. \n\nThere were a few good beer selections on draft...so that's a plus. But I definitely won't return. Life is too short for less than mediocre food. Salonika's is good in a pinch. I always find myself here when I have tickets to an 8pm show at the theater and I'm just rolling into the 6th Ave parking garage at 7:20, hungry, and without a reservation to any of the more popular downtown dinner spots (Sometimes I'm bad at planning). \n\nIt goes a little something like this: Order at the register, pay at the register, take a seat, wait 5 minutes for food to be delivered, inhale gyro and BAM! I can make it to the theater with enough time to find my seat and browse the playbill. The gyros are pretty good. I prefer mine with about half the provided onions and with the gyro sauce on the side so I can really slather it on. The staff here is always friendly and the prices are reasonable. This is an A-OK place all around. \n\nBonus: they are open fairly late. So if you haven't left yourself any time to eat before a show in the cultural district, you can stop in after the show is over (Yup, I've done this too when I'm EXTRA terrible at planning).", "user_id": "oM6CtEG2tK-4-nPVpimiFg", "business_id": "b9WZJp5L1RZr4F1nxclOoQ"}
{"text": "Monte Cellos is located fairly close to my work, and so I've gone a few times.  Each time, I ask myself, \"Why am I going back?\"\n\nMediocre dish after Mediocre dish, somehow I think it will get better next time.\n\nLast time I had a Grilled Chicken Salad that they're known for --- at least that's what the cashier said.  It was grilled chicken, french fries, a little cheese on chopped lettuce. Can you say B-O-R-I-N-G?\n\nToday I had a steak hoagie.  Enough places in Pittsburgh do these that comparing them is easy.  While the bread is fresh, and the hoagie buns are huge --- it's all downhill from here.  Enter three slices of steak-ums and the contents of the hoagie are just flat. The bread is 90% of the meal. Unmemorable.\n\nI was happy with the pizza I had there, but for salads and hoagies? Not so much. Edgar's Taco stand right outside on 21st between Liberty and Penn is fantastic.\n\nThe marinated lamb tacos are the best, although the chicken and beef tacos are good too.  The fish on the fish tacos were overpowered by the ingredients, and if you can't taste the protein then it's best to skip the dish altogether.\n\nThe guac is really good, and worth the extra $1.\n\nThis is definitely the real deal, and they are delicious.\n\nThere's almost always a short line -- they seem busy all the time.\n\nThe few tables and chairs right next to the stand are mostly in full sun.  These tacos are best enjoyed when they are hot and fresh, immediately off the grille.  Grab them, scarf them down, and move on!\n\nThe flavors are great.....\n\nRight next to Thin Man Sandwich shop which is pretty reliable as well! I like Salonika's.  I've been here a few times over the last couple months, and the food is consistently good.\n\nSome of the winning dishes are the baked chicken, chicken gyros, and definitely the lemon potatoes.  The salmon in pastry shell is also very good.\n\nThe staff is rushed but efficient.  Given how busy they can be, they get you in and out.\n\nEven when other lunch places are empty, you'll still find a restaurant full at Salonika's.  Part of it is the prices, which are reasonable. Part of it is that the food is mostly ready to serve, so it's fast.\n\nBut overall, the quality of the food is what keeps bringing me back, anyways. The Sicilian Pizza is huge, tasty, crusty on the outside, soft in the middle.  The regular thin crust pizza was loaded with toppings.\n\nMy only complaint is that the Pizza was served luke warm.  I want my pizza piping hot, almost burning the roof of my mouth!\n\nThe overall taste made up for the temperature difference, and I was happy with the overall experience.  Both the cooks and the waitress were friendly. Christos is a cute little place. It's been there for 38 years and I think that it hasn't changed much over the duration.  Sure the place is kitschy, but that's part of the charm.  The antiques and old photos were interesting to me, and there's some nice pieces there. The service is friendly, down to earth, and warm.\n\nThe owner showed me an award for the \"Jackie Onassis cake\" from 2009.\n\nWhile I want to love this place, the food is sub-par.  While the hummus was good (indeed thin as mentioned elsewhere) the Hercules special(lamb, beef, beans over rice) was just so-so.\n\nI want to see this place continue to succeed, but the food quality needs to be turned up a notch if that's going to happen.\n\nI'm rating 2.5 stars, but rounding up for the reasons mentioned.", "user_id": "5wTVzr3SyZzpiu-U_Yim6A", "business_id": "JcP-IIrZkW_Yyv4a0yLRCw"}
{"text": "This is more of a 3.5 star rating. I visited this restaurant with a large group of about 40 people before going to a show at the New Hazlett Theater. We were seated upstairs and ate a buffet-style dinner (the dishes had already been picked). The two waiters who took care of us were extremely friendly and efficient, and they made sure we would leave in time for our show. While we waited for the food to come out, they served us drinks, but the waiter stopped offering straws after the first couple tables.\n\nWhen the food came out, they let a few tables help themselves at a time. They provided us with three different types of plates (large square ones, rectangular ones, and small circular ones), which I found odd. We had three entrees in the buffet line: Chicken Marsala, Tomato Vodka pasta, and Parmesan Crusted Tilapia.\n\nChicken Marsala: flavorful, tender chicken served with mashed potatoes. I really enjoyed the potatoes because they had a distinct potato flavor, unlike most butter-heavy ones. However, I wish they were more generous with the tomatoes and mushrooms in the dish. There was no vegetable-based dish in our entire meal, and I missed them.\n\nTomato Vodka pasta: penne cooked with just a little bite left in a yummy tomato sauce with a couple leaves of spinach here and there. Again, I wished there was a lot more spinach in the dish. Also, the pasta was a little sauce-heavy.\n\nParmesan Crusted Tilapia: the fish was crispy and delicious, the angelhair pasta was cooked perfectly, and the tomato sauce was good. I grabbed some pasta near the edge that hadn't been touched by sauce, so I liked the amount. No vegetables, though.\n\nAfterwards, they brought out a tray of bite-size desserts for us. I don't see any of them on their menu, so I'm not sure how the organization ordered them. Both the cheesecake flavors I tried (raspberry and almond) were delicious--the cheesecake was really light and airy, and the flavors really came through without being overly sweet or overpowering. They also had strawberry halves and chocolate chip cookies, which were soft and cakey--not the best I've ever had, but pretty good. Also, there were these little squares that, as far as I could tell, were squares of iced cake covered in chocolate. These were way too sweet for my taste. Mine looked like chocolate everything, but there were also white-chocolate covered squares, and other squares with different colors inside (different flavors of icing, perhaps?).\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the food, but I'd like to try a greater variety before giving four full stars (and see if there are any vegetable-heavy ones). However, this restaurant is a little too expensive for me to return any time soon. The service was great. I came here with a large group of about forty people. We were seated quickly in the restaurant, which looks nothing like a warehouse. The walls are covered in various decorations, and there's a nice boisterous atmosphere.\n\nWe were served sourdough bread on wooden paddles, which also had cups of flavored butter. The bread was delicious--warm, crisp on the outside, and pillowy soft on the inside. The butter was a nice accompaniment. My friend got really excited when she realized we were coming here because she loved the bread, and she was super excited when we were served more.\n\nNext, we had salad. The iceberg lettuce was really crisp and fresh. It also had tomatoes, onions, croutons, and dressing. It wasn't bad.\n\nI ordered the 15-Layer Lasagne from the banquet menu (other choices included grilled chicken Caesar salad, spaghetti and meatballs, chicken parmesan, and manicotti). It was served with a little Italian flag toothpick. I really enjoyed the lasagna, especially because the meat was so flavorful. I don't eat lasagna much, but this was one of the best I've had.\n\nOverall, service was curt and there was too much waiting for my liking, but I can't provide an accurate representation because we were in a large group situation.\n\nI had a good experience here and definitely wouldn't mind returning!", "user_id": "IqjFenVF7ofLICCug9DfgA", "business_id": "Z101WZaISochG6g7tI2ZVw"}
{"text": "We decided to give brunch a try for our first visit to Casbah.  We were surprised  by the huge tent covering the \"outdoor\" dining area.  We opted for an inside table, the interior is somewhat small the tables are close together.  For brunch, you are served your choice of drink, appetizer and entree.  \n\nFor our drinks, BJ had a Bloody Mary and I had a Bellini.  We were served a basket of yummie bread and mini muffins.  For appetizers, we got a Three Sisters Farms mesclun greens and smoked salmon and truffled potato cake.  Very good.  For entrees we selected a jumbo lump crab & tomato omelet and the NY strip steak.  Very relaxing and tasty meal. I really like SoHo.  First off, it's located on the north shore and close to everything.  Nice bar, friendly staff, sleek and modern.  Great place to watch a game, LCD screens everywhere.  Skip the other appetizers and start with the angry shrimp.  They do a really good job with a filet mignon.  The salmon picata looked yummy, but since it wasn't mine, I didn't get to taste it.  If you don't want a big meal, they have all the usual sandwiches and burgers.  For dessert, have the banana bread pudding or some yummy chocolate fudge cake!  Or, if you're not feeling fancy, just throw back a few beers and bacon cheddar burger.  It's that kind of place, too. Okay, so it's not been my favorite week.  And after contemplating a dive off the Ft. Duquesne bridge, I followed some ex friend hag's advice and decided to get out of the house to go do something!  Now, being a typical woman, she suggested retail shopping therapy.  But I'm not one to blow my budget out of the water over a broken heart/bad-man-done-me wrong deal.  No way.  So, I go to Roland's.  Now, I'm not saying that they are better then a 1-800 help-me hot line.  But, they come darn close.  I had one of their famous hot lobster rolls.  Sure, David (hot & sweet little server) suggested that I consider having the cold roll, but no, I'm a woman.  I do not listen.  Hot, hot, hot.  Amy is right.  The buttery rolls do melt in your mouth.  The strawberry margarita wasn't half bad, either.   Actually, it was totally awesome.  While it didn't entirely make all my problems go away, it made me forget about them for an hour or so.  And so, life goes on..... The last time I ate at a Morton's was in Houston, TX, so I was very excited when BJ suggested that we dine here Saturday night. Had a 7:30 pm reservation, was greeted promptly and led to a comfy corner booth. The restaurant was very busy. Our server Georgeann was very friendly and hit it off right away with BJ. The two of them kept me entertained all night long! I don't know which one was the funniest. Well, BJ wins hands down. \n\nWe pondered the wine bible for a bit, but BJ is a beer dude (they have a somewhat limited selection) and I am more of a cocktail girl. Loved the cosmopolitans there. Very delicious. \n\nWe bypassed the appetizers, we both got Morton's salads, which were huge. I had a single cut filet and a crab cake, BJ also got a filet and bacon wrapped scallops. Both our steaks were very flavorful and cooked to perfection. For our sides, we shared asparagus and a loaded baked potato. \n\nWe could not pass on dessert. I had to have Morton's Legendary Hot Chocolate Cake and BJ had the Key Lime Pie. The chocolate cake was amazing, I love it. So did BJ.  He ate it instead of his pie.  We got the pie to go and it was also very, very good. \n\nGreat place for a special occasion. We had a wonderful evening.", "user_id": "UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}
{"text": "Here before Bucs VICTORY OVER THE CARDS in game 3 of the NLDS, a Sunday. Game at 4:30, got here at 2:30. Packed both inside and out. Can't comment on any other time but this really hectic one. \n\nOrdered Pepsi and brisket nachos. AWFUL. Soggy chips, some shredded beef drenched in sweet generic BBQ sauce, a blanket of cold congealed cheese spotted with jalape\u00f1o slices. Not a degree above room temp. \n\nWill give them 1 star for tasty Pepsi and keeping it filled. After originally writing this review for Open Table, and not until it was completed was I informed that it had to be trimmed to a brief highlight before it would be posted. FAIL OPEN TABLE REVIEWS!\n\nMorton's The Steakhouse, to the average joe, is a special occasion treat. It's prices are out of this world, especially when everything is a la carte. The restaurant-going public at large has gotten used to dining where choosing an entree entitles you to choose soup or salad, a vegetable and a starch. I've been here before, so I know not to expect anything with my steak besides a plate and flatware. Oh, and a napkin (and to be totally honest, bread and a glass, complete with water).\n\nHowever, since the star of the show here is steak, it's almost sacrilege to choose anything else. C'mon, the speciality of the house is right there in the restaurant's name! I went with the \"Signature Cut New York Strip.\" To be totally frank, it is quite possibly the best steak on the face of the planet. It comes with a beautiful char, perfectly cooked to perfection, with nary a blemish to be found. You will be using your knife, but never to cut away grizzle or fat. How does a steak taste this good, chew this well, and not have any fat vein? Not quite sure, but Morty seems to have it down to a science. My companion had the \"Center Cut Prime Ribeye\" and she agreed with my assessment of perfection.\n\nI saw many of the apps and sides being delivered to other tables, but after a soup (which I will describe in a moment) and steak, who could eat so much. The Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail app looked tantalizing, old-school style on a wide-rimmed glass, complete with dry-iced fog effects. The mashed potatoes and mac & cheese looked tempting, and were large enough to feed a group, but I can't attest to the flavor.\n\nWe started with a loaf of exceptional warm bread with flecks of toasted onion on the crust. It had a wonderful crumb, and I'd buy it from a bakery in a heartbeat. To begin I started with the Lobster Bisque, and my companion began with a Center-Cut Iceberg, or wedge salad. The wedge seemed perfectly adequate, inspire of it's Flintstones size. We both agreed that the Lobster Bisque was sublime! It had an incredible depth of lobster stock flavor. Speaking only for myself, though the bisque is the main attraction, the lobster island usually found floating in the middle is akin to the cherry topping an ice cream sundae. And I save it for the final sayonara spoonfuls. And in this case, it actually took down with it what went before. It was so overcooked as to be inedible, and rarely is ANYTHING inedible to moi. It had the mouthfeel of an underdone sponge, or perhaps soggy cotton balls. What a disappointment! I really couldn't tell if it was over or underdone.\n\nSo that last payoff, combined with the waiter's never-ending push to inflate the bill with dining accoutrements, were the only demerits from an otherwise exceptional meal!", "user_id": "s8Ki9RK9yRE7jk_qipnv5g", "business_id": "Z101WZaISochG6g7tI2ZVw"}
{"text": "Stopped in to get a bite to eat and some drinks before seeing a show earlier in the week on a Thursday. It wasn't very crowded and we were immediately greeted and seated. Service was okay not the greatest but not the worst either. Waitress came off as kind of nonchalant, but she checked on us throughout our meal and according to other reviews doesn't look like they even got that. Kitchen staff was slow in execution especially for not having a big crowd. \n\nI wasn't in the mood for seafood so I opted to try other things on their menu \n\nLOBSTER BISQUE -- \nHuge portion. I didn't expect to get as much in the bowl as I actually got. Although shallow, the bowl is large and you get a pretty decent serving in it. Despite the size, the flavor was lacking as well as texture. I've had some pretty delicious basques before and think it could be improved with a pinch of salt and corn for texture. It's missing something. \n\nGARLIC PARM WINGS -- \nGot an order of wings and they were good. Not an over powering flavor of garlic and not super duper oily. They used real garlic and it was served with it - minced. The wings were deep fried to a nice crispness so it added a little crunch which I liked. Served with common celery and your choice of rand and blue cheese. Not bad. \n\nMARGHERITA PIZZA --\nLooks better than it tastes. This can be easily split between two people - not a single server. The pizza is cooked in a wood fired oven and made very thin so it gets a nice crispy crunch. The crust was actually very good. It has a good texture to it and the lightly char taste you get from wood burning ovens was nice. I typically don't like that taste. Though I enjoyed the crust and what not - there was like no cheese on the pizza so it was way too saucy and lack-lustrous. Not what I would have expected so I was quite disappointed A friend and I paid a visit to Morton's for restaurant week in Pittsburgh for the winter. Usually when I go to restaurant weeks I don't expect the same quality if I came in any other week. I also am skeptical of how much I would enjoy expensive chain restaurants. I was pleasantly surprised when I came to Morton's. I thought everything was pretty good, so I think I want to try when it's not restaurant week to see how much better it is. \n\nStarted off with a tuna tartar and it was delicious. The tuna and avocado with their sauce as a garnish was great. The tuna seemed very fresh. For my entree I opted for the steak. It was tender and not chewy at all. It was perfectly cooked (medium rare) and required no other sauces besides how it was prepared. My friend got the pork chop which was also very well cooked. I can't pick which I preferred more. For the sides the mash potatoes were great. Creamy and buttery. But the broccoli side I got was pretty lack luster. It stated bland and as if they just boiled it for a few minutes. I would not recommend unless bland is what you're going for. For dessert we got a chocolate mouse which was way too rich in my opinion. We could only have a few bites each before it got to be too much. Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e left a bit to the imagination. The caramelization on top was mediocre and the creme was a very faint in taste. Plating of the dishes seemed very minimal, but I'm not sure if it was because of restaurant week or not. If not, there is improvement to be had. \n\nI enjoyed the entrees and the appetizer so I struggled between a 3 and 4 but gave the higher score because of service. Even though it was busy we were well attended to.", "user_id": "91nIj-xKzCvYdVGKSbu5eg", "business_id": "wHi8ODv7TGmeUB02XoX-mA"}
{"text": "I have eaten at Salonikas on 6th St. over a dozen times over the past three years.  I would eat here more often if it was more convenient.  To me, the gyro here is the best in Pittsburgh.  Better than ANY other.  Until someone can point me at a Gyro place that makes them like they do in some of the larger cities in the U.S., or like in Greece or Turkey, where they hand make the meat on a spit, it is lamb sliced thin, and placed in layers on a skewer, then slow roasted, and sliced and served while you watch, then Salonikas will remain the best.  \n\nSeriously, every single Gyro place around here just buys that big round slab of processed meat, and puts it on a spinner. Folks that say \"Oh it is seasoned so perfectly at XXXX\" are nuts.  No place around here makes their own lamb gyro meat. If you know of one, put it down, I want to go there.\n\nI like Salonikas because I like the pita, it is nice and thick and chewy, and they fry it on the flat top.  Places that don't heat the pita (like that place on the Strip that sells Gyros for $5 and he don't even heat the pita?!?!) They STINK!  \n\nI like the tszaziki (however you spell it).  It is nice and thick and well seasoned.  It does not go running down your arm when you take a big honking bite of your gyro.  \n\nI like the meat, it is seasoned so perfectly!  (!?!?!) Actually, they cook it long enough to make it a bit crusty, and they slice it nice and thin.  And they put on a LOT of it.  \n\nAnd all the veg is just right.  I wish they used hotter onions, but oh well.\n\nAnd best of all, they have a bar, that is VERY fairly priced.  Especially considering it is located so near the theatre district.  I also absolutely like all the other stuff they have, the spanakopata, and the moussaka, and the grape leaves.  Pretty much anything they sell.\n\nAnd keep this in mind, this place is inexpensive.  I mean seriously, the negative reviews this place gets all seem to say \"the prices are cheap, and tastes it\".  Well, bull.  The food is inexpensive, and what you get for what they charge, is way above what you expect.  Like, instead of ground lamb in some dishes, you get ground beef.  Still tastes good to me.  Not as great as it would be with ground lamb, but it keeps the price down, and it still tastes good.\n\nMy favorite time to eat here?  New Years eve, or Pittsburgh Light Up Night.  I have been here every one of those the past three years, they are packed, you get to have a gyro and a beer.  It is just a nice fun time.  And considering how busy they are, the staff are all way happier that at some of those pinky-in-the-air joiunts in the theatre district.\n\nOh, and the customers are all friendly.  Nice mix of blue collar and cops and folks getting a bite before or after some event in the cultural district.  I REALLLY like this place.  \n\nNow, next reviewer who throws down some ignorant review about how some other gyro is better, first, is it a REAL gyro, made with REAL thin sliced lamb, slow cooked on a spit and sliced off fresh and juicy, then PLEASE put the name of the place in your review.  I have tried EVERY gyro spot in the city, and quite a few outside it.  And I am STILL looking for a REAL gyro made like that.  Until then, this place is the best for me. I have eaten at the one on the Strip, and the one on the North Shore across from Nicky's Thai.  Both are great.  All I ever get is the steak with American cheese with onions and mushrooms.  They ask if you want tomatoes mayo and lettuce.  Have no idea why, that stuff should never be on a cheese steak sandwhich.\n\nAnyways, much better than Primanti's for a cheese steak.  primanti's you go to if you want say a steak hoagie (which is not steak but actually one of those rectangular seasoned beef patties on a hoagies roll.  Get that at Primantis with a fried egg, and fries and slaw, and you got a good sammy).\n\nFor a cheese steak, this is the only place in Pittsburgh to go.

{"text": "As a chinese american college student from NYC who got stuck in Pittsburgh with its useless public transportation (circa 1998), I desperately missed home-style Chinese food for the better part of my first two years here. Things turned around for me once I got a car (or made friends with cars), but I was seriously hurting for a while.\n\nTasty was one of the places we found. Back in the day, it was owned and ran by a typical restaurant-owning Chinese family. They had the works - pushy lao ban niang (boss lady), chef slash dad, and, during school off-hours, junior high school daughter manning the cashier. If they were in NYC, they'd only be missing an ami.... a bus boy. The food was pretty good, and if you order in Chinese, the lao ban niang hooked you up with extras because \"your parents teach you good to talk Chineees\". \n\nI'm pretty sure Tasty is under new ownership now. The food isn't as good as it was, but the restaurant still gives off the home-style look and feel. It's a small restaurant with enough seating for about 25-30 patrons. Cheap tables, cheap seats; after all, restaurant extras are just a waste of money. The customers should come back for the food, this *is* a restaurant.\n\nThe new waitress is not friendly, but she gets the job done. The food is still good - so if you're craving a home cooked meal, you'll be somewhat satisfied here. Don't expect grandma's cooking, though. Order the vegetables, the mapo tofu is good, beef/chicken chow fun, etc. They have a lot of other staple items on the menu too. Don't get the salted pork chops - save that craving for Orient Kitchen. Try things, and share your thoughts.\n\nTasty - it's more than your neighborhood take out joint.\n\n- written by a former junior high school daughter cashier I've been in Pittsburgh for a long time, and if you read through my reviews, you'll see that I love eating in Pittsburgh. I'm from NYC, so it's not that my palate is easy to satisfy. I just really think that Pittsburgh has great restaurants with authentic, and tasty foods. I am a serious advocate of dining in Pittsburgh, and I take pride in knowing the good places to eat. There, those are my self-proclaimed credentials. \n\nSo take this to heart: Andy's Sushi Bar (located in Wholey's) is probably the #1 place to get sushi/rolls in Pittsburgh. Now, a few caveats: it is NOT a restaurant, it is a stand inside Wholey's supermarket that does take-out orders ONLY. You will NOT get a dining experience, so for those of you who want to go to a nice japanese restaurant for dinner, you are not in luck. This sushi stand is only open for lunch, and typically closes at about 4pm on a weekday. You could be waiting about 15-30 minutes depending on the time/day you go because there is just one guy who makes the orders. He's fast, but his line can get long. \n\nTake it for what it is: Andy uses fresh and tasty fish. He cuts you big pieces for both his a la carte pieces and his rolls. He will make you any custom order you'd like provided he has the ingredients. He does have a limited selection of Sushi/Sashimi platters. He has a good spider roll and after going a few times, definitely ask for the \"Chef's Special\" -- he just loads up a roll for you. You won't be disappointed.\n\nAnd, as for prices, it's the best bang for your buck for sushi. what more could you ask for.", "user_id": "Zff7xm0J-C7hV1z3j-JipQ", "business_id": "Y2p07YEC8xOsYTHWf0UxiA"}
{"text": "Very close to work for me and the others in my office.  Was excited about getting a steak salad, which I found is a staple here in the Burgh.  The first one I got in July 2012 was good.  I don't know if the method of cooking or person cooking the steak had changed or the meat supplier is different, but after that, I've had two steak salads where the meat was just too tough!  Haven't been back since.  Probably won't go back to get a salad until the meat is cooked tender and not left to become shoe leather.  Not getting a salad again unless someone can convince me that the meat was just cooked and juicy!  \n\nPizza's are yummy and pizza lovers will like their small but adequate pizza buffet which has about 8 different types of pizza.  \n\nThe restaurant is always crowded  at lunch time.  There is a large turnover of pizza so it's always hot. Andy the Sushi Guy.  \nFast, entertaining, friendly and did I say fast?  No worries about standing in line and taking a few minutes of your busy day to watch Andy work his magic.  After all, it's not often one can find a fresh fish market with the freshest sushi ingredients. And you can bet Andy the Sushi Guy won't skimp on ingredients.  \nWe stopped by on Saturday about lunchtime when Wholey's is packed with its Saturday shoppers, which is it's usual crowded busy-ness.  Andy's Special for the day:  Tuna & Kiwi  or  Salmon & Avocado FAT Rolls.  Yes, the special of the day is usually a FUTO maki extraordinaire.  \nWe ordered the Tuna & Kiwi and Andy's Sushi Combo.  \nTuna & Kiwi began with crispy dried nori (seaweed) topped with an ample amount of fluffy sushi rice.  Smeared on is Tobiko (flying fish eggs) with its bright orange color. Just as you're admiring his steadfastness, POP goes the rice ladened seaweed as  Andy flips the seaweed to create a reverse sushi roll.  Folks, I'd have to disagree with another Yelper when they say that nori goes on the outside. What's not to like about creativity? And personally, what's not to like about more ingredients that you can stick on the outside of a sushi roll?  Like Tobiko or sesame seeds? hhmm...???? \nContinuing with the innerds of the Tuna & Kiwi roll, more Tobiko, asparagus, seared tuna with a light breading, red leafed lettuce, fresh tuna and kiwi...a la Andy's Special of the day.  Roll up all of these and keeping it in tact so when the slicing begins, all of the innerds remain in tact. Whoosh!  Did you see how he picked up the whole futomaki (fat roll) and placed it in the clear togo container, fan it out, add an ample handful of shyoga (thinly sliced pickled ginger) and a hunk of wasabi (no explanation needed) with soy sauce in a mini condiment cup. Sushi a la Andy the Sushi Guy at Wholey's~~It's what's for dinner!\nIf Andy didn't cut the roll, it would take two hands to pick it up and eat it like a ginormous fat burrito, kinda like you'd get in one of them hole in the wall Tex-Mex joints down close to the border (the US Border, that is).  But it is cut into yummy 8 slices and is done quickly without smushing down the circular form. Instead, admire the sliced sushi serving as you lay it flat and be amazed at the color and textures of the ingredients. Not only does it have fresh fish, but some veggies to add to your daily vitamin intake.  \nThe only 'drawback' and I think that is what some of the sushi connoisseurs are quick to point out, is that the sushi rice is not seasoned.  Yes, folks, traditional sushi rice is seasoned with a slight glaze and a very subtle sweetness.  Now, if Andy seasoned the sushi rice as sushi rice should be seasoned, then I'd have to give the guy at least a 4.5 star rating (fresh ingredients, ample servings, creativity, appearance or presentation and seasoned sushi rice on top of all of that). \nI think I'm going to have to defend Sushi a la Andy against the folks looking for 'traditional sushi' in a sit down sushi bar.  You ain't gonna find it here.  And if that's the limit on your sushi palate, then you're certainly coming to the wrong place!  For if you're looking for fast, fresh and ample, this is it.  The bonus:  Andy treats you with friendly hospitality and part of the Wholey's family.", "user_id": "HzLV7YPCkrs5tIn382uwSA", "business_id": "JcP-IIrZkW_Yyv4a0yLRCw"}
{"text": "Not really sure what to add.  So I'll bullet point my experience.\n\n- Expensive poorly made drinks\n- Friendly but slow service\n- Ok food considering (Had the Philly Steak and Cheese)\n- Over run with kids before 10 that seem to have zero adult supervision\n- 15% of the games were out of order (Air Hockey, Big Bball Game, 1/2 of the skee ball, random other arcade machines)\n- Expensive games\n- Fun time overall with the wife. Coffee, dry beans, bulk foods, fresh fruits, and veggies oh my.\n\nOnce a staple place of mine when living in Friendship and Point Breeze, now a novelty that strikes up fond memories.  Even now that I live in the North Hills I still enjoy to seek out the East End Food Co-op on a semi-regular basis.  I go there for the bulk bins mainly, but always end up grabbing some other things.  Their fresh fruit and vegetable selection is always good and cheaper than Whole Foods and Market District for sure.  I am a gigantic fan of their whole coffee bean selection as well.  Very good place.  And not swarming with hippies all the time, though that's not that bad of a thing. Beer and Dogs.  This isn't your ballgame 7 dollar Miller Lite and generic hotdog either.  This is 7 dollar Chimay and a loaded Chicago style dog heaven.  A lengthy review of a place that relies entirely on beer and hot dogs would be redundant, so I'll keep this short.\nGreat atmosphere, Decent enough staff, Fair prices, BEST beer list anywhere I've ever been!  If they don't have something you want on draft chances are you can find it in their beer cave.  And the hot dogs and fries are always atop the City's Best.\nIf that isn't enough to get you stop by D's then you're missing the point and probably shouldn't anyhow. A real taco in the 'Burgh.  Four stars would easily be five if their portions were just a tad bigger, but wow is the food here good.  Reyna has been satisfying true taco lovers with amazing tacos for awhile now and it finally seems that the rest of Pittsburgh has caught on.  There always seems to be a line of people salivating for the fresh ingredients and unique flavors that only Reyna offers in the Golden Triangle.  I absolutely love their beef tongue taco and their pulled pork version.  The salsas are fantastic and people are always mucho friendly.\nDo yourself a favor and eat your way through Pittsburgh's Strip and get one or eight tacos from the friendly folks at Reyna. Prime time location, and they know it.\n\nYet another older guard restaurant that realizes it has people roped in before they know it.  The place looks nice and is possibly the best location during the summer especially in the city.  I have always steered clear of Roland's because of an assumption.  But....the wife and her friend wanted a \"lobster roll\" so I was roped into going.  I opted to just drink a draught.  They got one of their famous lobster rolls and immediately were underwhelmed.  The sandwich was dwarfed by a mountain of handcut fries (the best part).  It also came with a limp pickle speer and a small condiment cup of coleslaw?!  The roll itself was lobster, but was fishy tasting and had no sauce?!  There was maybe 3ozs of fishy lobster on the roll.....Pathetic.\nService was decent and my draught and few fries got this place the extra star it deserves.\n\nGo to Wholey!!!! As much as a sushi fan as I am I going to stick my neck out and say this is the best sushi in Pittsburgh.  Here is my reasoning.\n\nAndy is not just a funny guy, but is very generous.  Go when it's not busy and be prepared to be handed big chunks of raw fish with his different sauces.  Talk to him and get ready for sushi rolls bursting with fresh fish.  \nNext the place is in Wholey Fish Market, Wholey gets fresh fish daily, so you know his sushi is going to be some of the freshest in Pittsburgh.\nFinally, the price, load up on Andy's rolls and sashimi for the fairest price in the city.

I can't really speak on the coffee, though they do have good tissanes(however getting them to refill your hot water is another thing).\n\n**************\nOkay I won't change my rating, but I take back what I said about the food. They have changed the menu and it is really bad. \n\nWe had Buffalo Tofu sticks which were ridiculously dry. \n\nI had the Thai Peanut Tofu Wrap which tasted just like peanut butter. \n\nI don't understand the point of Mockamole?

The food isn't particularly memorable. I enjoy the fish sandwih. Fries are good. It's great for groups. It can get quite busy. Sushi Kim is one of those Korean restaurants you'll find in most N. American cities that don't have a really big Korean population. They tend to diversify into sushi as well as Korean food, which is probably a good move considering the American palate and their general unawareness of Korean cuisine outside of the major Korean enclaves. It's pretty obvious by their name, they aren't trying to hide the fact they are Korean.\n\nI've been there for both Korean BBQ on the second floor and Korean food on the main floor.  I wouldn't trek all the way from CMU to have sushi there since sushi can be more easily had, but definitely for the Korean food. Some would disagree, but I have friends from Seoul who even think Sushi Kim has the best Korean food in Pittsburgh.(Granted we are speaking for Pittsburgh) It is pricier than Korea Garden, but the atmosphere is slightly more \"upscale.\"\n\nThey also have at least 3 brands of soju(Charm, Cheoeum cheo reom, and  Jinro Chamisul), which for Pittsburgh is quite exceptional even though I would only drink the Chamisul. They also have Korean noraebang, which you have to reserve in advance. However they only have Korean songs, so if you can't read Korean you're out of luck. They charge $30/hour. I'm not sure there is any other Korean noraebang in the city. I didn't try it, so I can't say what kind of selection they have for songs.\n\nThe BBQ is a great deal and though not the best I've ever had. It may be the only Korean BBQ grill place in the city. The staff is quite attentive and is pretty good about replacing the grills. I would prefer a different sahm-jang and more variety in the non-BBQ items in the buffet. The BBQ is great for groups and seats 4 people for each grill.", "user_id": "hFhHmfwRPkN81NJZkrnRjQ", "business_id": "PzG0XmAmtXFs6Fdnubf41g"}
{"text": "This is the full-scale taco bell location closest to CMU.\n\nwhat else....\n\nit's a taco bell! besides from trying to confirm that i was out of my mind when i ordered 10 doritos locos tacos and a locos tacos box, the staff here are friendly and make great taco bell tacos. I browsed the market itself, which was a bit smaller than i expected. i guess that what the market had were the things that one could find practically nowhere else in pittsburgh in order to make some decent authentic mexican/caribbean dishes. frankly, even though i only visited it a week ago, it was definitely not a very memorable store.  drink selections were lacking with little more than the usual jarritos.\n\ni tried the taco stand outside next: while they said they offered empanadas, it was sunday afternoon around 1PM and the gentleman said that they had run out.  Frankly they take these ready-made empanadas and microwave them before serving them to the customer, so i don't understand why they coudln't have just gotten some more from the huge mound of empanadas i saw in the store just minutes before. but i was too lazy to ask. also, they microwave the empanadas on styrofoam plates....no comment.\n\nthe 1 taco for $3/ 2 tacos for $5 was probably the best deal that I could find in pittsburgh for some close to authentic mexican tacos as i coudl find.  They indeed pack your taco with a lot of the fixings, but in doing so, they don't realize that all the juicyness that comes from the meat (especially the lengua) causes the little corn tortilla to rip very easily.  i have not been any other mexican joint that serves these style tacos with only one little corn tortilla: they're always made with two corn tortillas with the presumed purpose of protecting rippage.  one star off for that.  The salsa on the side that was left out that was the perfect consistency of the type of salsa i like (non chunky) was somehow too dry.  this may have been due to lack of freshness.  if only it were fresher, it would have been a nice complement to my tacos. on the upside, they prepare the meat from scratch, putting a little blot of uncooked meat on their grill, while they prepare it in front of your eyes. that was a welcome difference for this joint compared to other taco joints.\n\nall in all, compared to the other place in pittsburgh i've tried for tacos (Mexico City), I'd much rather come here.  closer, cheaper, and tastier. mexico city does not do mexican food justice. First off, this restaurant is absolutely HUGE. there are a ton of tables, so i'm going to say that this place is good for groups..  When we went on a friday night, there were only about 7 tables occupied, with my friend and I sitting alone at the sushi bar.\n\nWe came here because we wanted sushi and rolls.  None of the pittsburgh restaurants seem to specialize very much in rolls, and of the sushi restaurants near shadyside/oakland, this one seemed to offer the most number of rolls (please let me know if you know of other ones nearby that offer more!)  We got a 12 piece combination sushi platter, a kim's favorite roll (which actually seemed like two separate rolls totaling 16 pieces), and a spider roll.  While the sushi and rolls were of acceptable size, the fish was definitely not very fresh.  the spider roll was probably one of the most repulsive rolls i've tasted in a while.  the soft shell crab was fried beyond recognition, and it took too much effort to chew as the crunching resounded loudly within my head.\n\nMy friend and I also split a soon doo boo, which came with a bowl of rice and a few miniplates of banchan.  while the soon doo boo was acceptable, with a lot of tofu inside, the banchan was pretty underwhelming. broccoli, pretty weak kimchi, bean sprouts...\n\nand sadly our bill came out to be way too much for a regular sushi dinner. after tax and tip, my friend and i each paid ~35.  while the service was friendly, i will probably not be coming back here again.", "user_id": "oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg", "business_id": "JL5B_s1EoN4zIru4JSw4Qg"}
{"text": "I'm not sure why this place is called Casbah.  Casbah conjures up images of genies and sand dunes or something.  Nothing about this place seems remotely middle eastern to me, other than the name.\n\nThat aside, good food and great service.  Definitely a place to impress.  I especially enjoy patronizing establishments that focus on seasonable, sustainably harvested ingredients, and although Casbah is not doing the whole \"locavore\" thing, it certainly is striving for the organic and seasonal thing.  So, off the bat, that gives it big points in my book.\n\nWe started with the calamari and the squash ravioli.  Skip the ravioli - small and kind of dried out.  But the calamari was MEATY and perfectly fried.  I actually had to stop because I was feeling ill from eating too many of them.\n\nWe all had the argula salad, which was delicious.  Quite sizeable too, given the setting.  Finally, I had the scallop and crab meat... uh... pasta dish (I have no idea what kind of pasta it was... sorry).  Which was quite good.  I actually would have preferred it over linguine, I think, but whatever.  It was deelish.\n\nNot sure why I'm not giving this place five stars.  I really enjoyed it, but it wasn't a WOW experience.  Better luck next time perhaps. We've figured out where all the hipsters go on the weekend for brunch!\n\nReally excellent french toast, just like my dad used to make. I had the breakfast burrito, which I thought was OK, but not something I would order again. But, more importantly than the food, we just really liked the atmosphere. Sitting there in their mismatched, vintage-y looking diner, I felt like I was in the Mission in SF (OK, maybe minus the fact that everyone was sporting their winter gear, which would never be necessary in CA). Kid friendly too, if that's important to you. I enjoyed this place, but wasn't completely wowed.  I was told that it's Portuguese, but I'm not seeing what's so Portuguese about it.  Certainly a good Continental restaurant, by any means.  \n\nI liked the atmosphere, and the service was good.  And the food was good too.  But for the price, I didn't think the food was THAT great.  I'll come again, but it won't be because I'm the one suggesting it. OK, so I admit that I was underwhelmed by Cafe Zinho when I first went, a few years ago.  And then I didn't go for a long time.  A few months back, my husband and I randomly decided to give it another try, and boy am I glad we did!  It's fantastic, and has quickly become part of our regular line up.\n\nI'll say again that I'm not certain how the food is Portuguese.  That being said, it is mighty delicious.  I love the personal service.  I love the corn bread.  The starters are phenomenal, to the point where I sometimes think that the entrees are superfluous.  But when we get them, they are lovely too.  I love the ambiance.  In short, I owe Cafe Zinho an apology. A group of friends and I went to try out the Korean BBQ. Apparently that is only available on the weekends, so be warned. We started off a bit on the wrong foot, because we had made reservations in advance, only to be told when we got there that another, larger party had booked out the upstairs BBQ area, so they wouldn't be able to accommodate us. After staging a bit of a hissy fit, they were able to find a place for us, and the adventure commenced.\n\nSo, having had Korean BBQ in both New York and San Francisco, I can't say that I thought this was the best experience. The kim chi selection is pretty limited when you're used to being plied with multiple little plates of different kinds of tasty kim chi. Here, they only give you the pickled cabbage. If you're looking for vegetables, this is not your place. You can take marinated bulgolgi, kalbi, pork, and chicken, plus there's calamari and shrimp for seafood eaters. The chicken was really tasty, but the rest of the selection was a bit bleh. As one of my friends put it, the bulgolgi from Trader Joe's is better than what we had here.\n\nIf you go, be nice to your tablemates and try to rotate the cooking duties. It's really lots of fun to go with friends and to have a communal experience, so even though I'm not sounding like I had a great time, the reality is that we all had a lot of fun and enjoyed ourselves. But don't go thinking that you are going to have the culinary experience of your life.", "user_id": "Vy6oxUFDSGCLmNA6GoA1tQ", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}
{"text": "I only go here when I can't get into Burgatory and because I enjoy the outdoor area with the firepit which is a pretty cool atmosphere.  Their really unhealthy food options like the loaded fries or loaded tots are pretty good, but their healthier food options are really lacking.  I tried to get the blackened fish tacos and the fish was really dry and overcooked and of poor quality.  The tortillas were completely stale and hard and had large gashes down the middle.  They have a decent beer selection but when I asked what their seasonal Great Lakes on tap was they said the Christmas ale (it's the last week in April now). I knew that if I ordered that draft it would be quite stale as it's probably been in there for 6 months now, so I got a Southern Tier instead which was good.  The service is ok but rather slow.  Overall I'm pretty underwhelmed by this place. Awesome place! I discovered this when I was looking for a place to buy beer to go by the bottle that had a good variety, then I discovered this place was a full bar/restaurant.  Besides getting bottles to go, you can also drink from any of their many drafts on tap or their individual bottles.  Many are already in a chilled section, but they also have a beer chiller machine that can chill a room temp bottle in like 5 minutes! And they have a huge selection of beers, both imported and local microbrews.  They also have a nice menu with a variety of things, including hot dogs, hamburgers, salads, etc.  Hot dogs are one of their specialties and I'm not a huge hot dog fan but the bratwurst I had with bacon and mac-n-cheese on top was amazing! I also had the fried zucchini appetizer which was cooked perfectly and the sauces were very tasty (marinara and a spicy ranch-like sauce).  I went on a Wednesday evening post-happy hour and was surprised how super crowded it was, so it may be hard to get a table on weekend nights. This is a little sushi bar in Wholey's fish market and the sushi is excellent and Andy has such a fun, friendly and sassy personality that makes waiting in the long line to get your sushi more entertaining.  The rolls are relatively large with good portions of fish.  The only drawback is that he doesn't always follow the ingredients in the menu precisely (I got avocado instead of scallion and he put some mysterious sauce on it that was not on the menu).  I'm not that picky and liked it anyway but people who are more particular might be turned off by this. I didn't have the awful experience some had here based on prior reviews, but it was definitely mediocre.  I went on a Wednesday evening and the place was totally dead except maybe one couple sitting by the sushi bar part of the time I was there.  Which is sad because they have such a huge space with 2 levels, lots of seating, and great proximity to both the Strip and downtown.  A lot more could be done with this place.  \n\nThe menu was printed in very poor quality with what could have been nice pictures of food options but they were super fuzzy and hard to see.  It seemed like their Korean menu was pretty varied but I had come for the sushi.  I ordered the Kim's Favorite Roll which was described as \"Tuna, Yellowtail, Broiled Eel, and Salmon\"  but what I wasn't expecting was the salmon to be cooked all the way through.  Maybe I  should have read it as \"broiled eel and salmon\" but that wasn't clear or typical of this sort of roll.  Normally eel is cooked but the other fish are raw unless specified otherwise.  Maybe you'd have a fried roll or something baked or seared on the top, but to cook one type of fish that is normally raw and mix it inside with 2 raw types just seems strange to me.  So it ended up being a really odd combination with the raw tuna and yellowtail next to the cooked sushi which wasn't so great all squished together inside the roll.  The sushi roll was quite large at 16 pieces, but I still felt that 18.95 was really pricey considering the quality of the fish was only mediocre with small portions, and they used a TON of rice. The quality of the fish was again just ok.  Not super fresh but not bad either.  The rolls (and those of my friends) kept falling apart as we tried to eat them.  It seemed they weren't properly wrapped or maybe it was just that they tried to use way too much rice.  One fun thing was that all the rolls came out on little boats, so that was a nice touch.  The roll also came with a miso soup, which was fine but nothing special.  The miso soup didn't have the awful taste some others here reported but it tasted like what I'd make from a powered package rather than made fresh.  I also got the shrimp shumai which were again just ok, and tasted like what I could get from the freezer section of an asian store and microwave myself rather than made fresh.  \n\nOne person at our table got a Korean dish which came with 4 side dishes that were all vegetable except for the fish cakes.  She said her food tasted decent but the beef bul go gi dish she got just didn't look right or have the proper color it should have had.  Just liked kind of dry and plain.  When I went to the restroom I was disturbed to see trays of the Korean side dishes in the hallway just sitting out in the open not covered or anything!  It would be different if the restaurant were bustling but it was totally dead and pretty clear those wouldn't be eaten that evening (so I shudder to think that after hours sitting out uncovered unrefrigerated that they put them out again the next day and hoped someone would eat them...).  If you aren't that busy there is no reason things can't be prepared to order!  That is simply lazy.  Also I overheard part of a conversation between a waiter and a guy at the sushi bar about something being \"expired\" and what to do about that.  Unfortunately I couldn't hear all the details but it was disturbing since this was after we all had gotten our food already.  I mean it's good they are being mindful of expiration dates but it sounded like someone had to be schooled on it based on what I heard.  But granted that I only heard bits and pieces so I can't say for sure.  I don't think I'll go back here again.", "user_id": "GMtILOfAHXUMrfMgLPG0gg", "business_id": "EoAY1JSVeJriBzId8lUQwQ"}
{"text": "This is one of those places where the presentation is nice, but the taste is too ordinary. Friends and I went here for happy hour (starting at 5pm). They claimed to have $1 draft, $5 mixed drinks, and half off appetizers. When we got there, we realized the happy hour special only applies to certain items, so pretty much the discount was pointless. We ended up spending a fortune on beer and mediocre appetizers. \n\nI only had appetizers here so I can't really judge them for their entr\u00e9es, but I will rate according to my eating/drinking experience.  I got the spinach artichoke dip. It was a little runny and the dip to chips ratio was disappointing. For a dip, it had way too many obstacles built in to it. I don't know what they did with the artichoke, but it was super fibrous...I felt like I was chewing grass. \n\nOverall, I would not recommend this place unless you have money to make it rain. Food was way too average for the high price. They claimed on their website that they have \"the best wings in town\". As a seeker of good wings, let me tell you about my adventure with this place. \n\nEverything started fine with our order of 24 wings with three separate sauces for 3 eaters. The wings arrived exactly an hour later with the exact number of wings promised and a side of celery. Here's the catch...THERE WAS NO SAUCE! My party of three decided to just tough it out and eat the wings plain. They were, I kid you not, so bland that I wasn't sure what I was eating. They literally just threw the wings in the fryer and delivered it to us. So once we realized how unbearable the plain wings were, we called and complained about the sauce. About 40 minutes later, the sauce arrived. At this point, the wings got cold and our hunger turned into an unbearable rage. We tried BBQ, Garlic Parmesan and Spicy. The sauces were just average. The spicy sauce was so weak that I should've just settled with a bottle of sirracha. \n\nThe deliver guy gave us a cannoli as an apology....ONE CANNOLI....3 eaters! You get the point. But this gives me the chance to tell you how terrible the cannoli was. The outer shell was soggy and the filling made me gag a little. It looked nice, but didn't taste that great. \n\nSo after 1 hour and 40 minutes, 24 wings, 3 sauces and a cannoli... we have 3 very unhappy customers. The wings were the most mediocre wings I have ever tasted. I will NOT order here again for the wings NOR will I recommend it to the fellow wings connoisseurs out there. Final verdict: MOST MEDIOCRE wings in town! I cringed when I saw that their BBQ buffet price went up to $24/person, considering that I can go to a seafood buffet 10 minutes away for much less. Sushi Kim is a clean and bright place with seats on all two floors. The Korean BBQ buffet is on the second floor and only available on Friday and Saturday evenings starting at 5pm. \n\nThe service was wonderful and the servers really helpful. The Korean BBQ is buffet style, so you help yourself to the raw proteins and vegetables at the buffet bars and then cook them on your hot plate at your table. It's a really fun and interactive eating experience. There weren't that many choices for proteins, but the choices that were available were all delicious. Protein choices ranged from mussels and shrimps to pork, chicken and beef. My favorite was the bulgogi beef. \n\nThere were a few things I disliked about the Korean BBQ at Sushi Kim though. First off, they offered no butter or oil for the BBQ. I understand that they are trying to keep things healthy and all, but without any grease, the food was easily burnt. Butter or oil should always be an available option. Secondly, I did not like the design of their hot plates--the interior cooking area was way too tiny so it took forever to cook the food. And finally, they need to add a DESSERT BAR. After eating all that grilled food, I craved something sweet and refreshing. But, Sushi Kim left me hanging. Sushi Kim is already charging a whopping $24 per person--it would be nice if they throw in a dessert bar to sweeten up the deal (pun intended). \n\nOverall, I'm very thankful there is a Korean BBQ place in Pittsburgh. For being the only Korean BBQ buffet place in the area, it deserves a standing ovation. I had a great time at Sushi Kim and would gladly recommend the Korean BBQ buffet special. Buffet price was a bit high though, so crack open that piggy bank!", "user_id": "hkbwjnY42LDloMV84Yoy5g", "business_id": "EoAY1JSVeJriBzId8lUQwQ"}
{"text": "I came here just before a Pirates game so it was extremely busy. As a result I sat at the bar. I ordered the Pacific Salmon salad and it was absolutely delicious. The service was very friendly and attentive. The price seemed reasonable. My only issues were that there were some left over plates of food nearby that were waiting to be taken away that sort of detracted from the experience. Also, my plate did not seem 100% clean although it really wasn't a big issue. Given how busy they were I do understand and still give high marks for the tasty food and excellent service. I've come here for German Language meetups and their soups are always delicious. Last Saturday I had Chicken and Wild Rice in a bread bowl, which was very good and filling, which was perfect since I missed breakfast. I also recall sometime ago I had one of their chocolate chip cookies that was excellent. The establishment is clean and well laid-out. They always seem to have a nice selection of soups salads and desserts. I've never seen it get too crowded which allows for good conversation without any need to shout. I am a satisfied repeat customer. As I was passing by this place the owner (I think it was the owner) got my attention and persuaded me to look at the menu. Seeing that he was anxious for business I obliged and took a seat outside. I had the Taramasalata, which I believe was the mashed caviar, which was pretty good but didn't seem much different from Hummus. For my entree I ordered the Roasted Leg of Lamb, which came with a salad, rice pilaf and veggies. The lamb was okay nothing great and the rice I felt was a tad mushy and seemed like either too much water was added or it didn't all evaporate or absorb. The  salad, which I had with anchovies was very good as were the mixed veggies, which seemed to have an authentic flare to it. I also ordered dessert, which was a slice of cake with whipped cream and drizzlings of cinnamon, which was good but nothing special. The service was good as the owner was attentive to my needs. While I ate outside, I did go inside to pay and noted the Greek decor which was appealing.\n\nAll in all, I can tell the owner cares and made a reasonable effort to accommodate me. That said I think this is a nice establishment in an excellent location, but the food needs a step up. It wasn't bad, but there is room for improvement. Here is what I recommend: rice needs to be better prepared and perhaps have some nuts, raisins or garnish added to it, the lamb could be thicker, have the fat and/or tough parts removed and also have a stronger marinade or come with a gravy or sauce for more flavor, and maybe the mashed caviar could be mixed in with some unmashed caviar, which would give it much more flare and appeal. I ordered the entree that had ground beef with sesame oil and vegetables and I found it to be delicious. I also found the service to be very friendly and thorough. The waitress told me there would be a longer wait time for my dish so I would be prepared. Then after my meal she was apologetic about the wait and service, of which I really had no criticisms to offer. I found the interior to be very decorative.\n\nI've come across the other reviews that seem to be more directed at the Sushi and during non-busy hours. I went late Saturday evening and it was very busy. Also, the price was reasonable. In regards to the food my only gripe was that the ground meat seemed cold, but the rest of the meal was delicious. \n\nIn all honesty given the overall experience, I am being borderline nit-picky to dock a whole star from the rating. Regardless, the food was very good and the service excellent.", "user_id": "5z6ZXMg3-XO3UmSxpZWBUA", "business_id": "Z101WZaISochG6g7tI2ZVw"}
{"text": "I went to Casbah for the first time a couple years ago and remembered not being too happy with my experience. I decided to give it another shot, and I'm very happy with my decision to do so. \n\nLast night I arrived to Casbah around 9:15. The kitchen closes at 10:00 so we were fine. The male at the host stand seemed pretty irritated that we were just arriving but it wasn't like I was walking in at 9:55. We opted to sit inside because it was a little chilly. He the two of us down at a table against the wall in the very back. It was tiny and cramped and not too mention very poor lighting. Almost felt like I was punished to that table? So I asked our server to be moved to another table in the restaurant. \n\nWe served some bread and sea salt butter. In my opinion, the bread was nothing special. I had a few bites and didn't finish much just because I wanted to save room for the more important dishes. We were also served some type of Greek yogurt for the bread but that combination didn't sound appetizing to me. \n\nI ordered a 3 cheese selection option as an appetizer. I regret it a little bit now just because I was served the same bread. I added the prosciutto for an extra $4 and it was very good. I picked the first 3 cheeses on the menu (forget exactly what they were). I would have like the server to tell me which cheese was which, but I enjoyed them nonetheless. \n\nIn addition I also had the Charred Spanish rock octopus which was the highlight of the entire meal. I highly recommend it. \n\nI had the Casbah (signature, as I was told) double-cut pork chop. This cut was very large and I ended up taking most of it to go. The rice was phenomenal, especially the rice that was under the meat. It had absorbed the flavors from the meat. \n\nFinally, I decided on the pistachio cannoli. I had a tough time deciding between that and the chocolate pot de creme. The flavor seemed to be a little off and I think i would have like the filling to be a bit sweeter.  I also opted for the Greek dessert wine pairing, which they only able to serve me half a glass because they ran out. It ended up being free, so I didn't mind. \n\nMy server was very knowledgeable about the menu and was able to explain things very clearly. However, I HATE when servers go take a smoke break and then leave my table smelling like an ashtray. Off putting as I was eating my cannoli dessert. \n\nPretty good experience, but could have been amazing. I had a pretty negative experience for my first trip to Sushi Kim. I have always heard how great this place was and the patron is immediately greeted by photos and plaque cards of the restaurant's accomplishments. \n\nI was greeted by a non-Asian male, who was very seemingly very timid and shy. After a first glance, I noticed that some of my favorite Korean foods were no where to be found. I inquired with this male as to whether or not there was an alternative menu or whether these very common Korean dishes could be made. He had absolutely no idea what I was talking about. He looked at the sushi menu and just told me to order what he thought was the closest thing.  \n\nKorean barbecue requires either the patron or the server to cook at the table. We had a different server cook my bulgogi. Another non-asian male who basically refused to speak with us. I could tell English was his second language, but he was extremely unpardonable. We sat in awkward silence because of his presence while cooking. \n\nThe Korean fried dumplings were very delicious, I will say that! \n\nI will give Sushi Kim another chance because I know others rave about it.", "user_id": "cQzLh-dCpM-C_cDYycPlww", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}
{"text": "I've loved coming here since it first opened as part of the Waterfront shopping development, and I'm always up for a game of skee-ball!  The Pittsburgh D&B location is recently remodeled, so if you haven't been there in a while, do yourself a favor and check it out.  They've expanded the dining areas and added new, modern furniture, there are more TVs than you can shake a stick at, a menu with something for everyone, and of course... games!  They also recently opened a new show in their theater room -- Pittsburgh magician Lee Terbosic will be performing 2 shows every Friday and Saturday night.  You can even order drinks and food off the menu while you take in the show!\n\nI went to the opening show this past Friday night, and ordered a chicken quesadilla and a \"sno-cone\" (hint: this drink isn't one for the kiddos!) to wash it down with.  Both were great -- the sno-cone flavors were just like an ICEE I would get on a childhood shopping trip with mom and dad, but with that added kick of booze.  Hey, I'm not one to complain.  Speaking of added kicks, the quesadilla has jalapenos in it, which I loved!! I love spicy foods and most places just serve a little cup of jalapenos on the side.  These were actually cooked into the fillings and I loved every bite.\n\nThe show itself was highly entertaining and the crowd seemed to agree -- Lee kept everyone on their toes for the entire 60 minutes.  I can't wait to check out more shows here and flex my skee-ball arm! I stopped here for dinner with my boyfriend after an evening exploring and photographing Washington's Landing.  I've dined at Redfin Blues once before, but it was several years ago.  We are always up for some good seafood and figured Redfin Blues would be a good choice since we don't really get out that way all too often.\n\nLately, we've been hooked on oysters, but I was disappointed to find that this place doesn't serve them at all.  I was willing to look past it after seeing plenty of other seafood items on their menu, and we settled on a cup of the Redfin Bisque each  and decided to split a large shrimp and crab pizza.\n\nThe Redfin Bisque was absolutely delicious... my only gripe is that it's a VERY small portion for the $6 price tag.  For that price, I expected a large bowl of soup, but instead it's just a small cup that I downed in about 2 minutes.  The flavor was great, it was the perfect temperature, but the portion size for the price might make me hesitant to order it again next time. \n\nThe seafood pizza came out shortly after and it smelled heavenly.  Even the waitress commented on how good it looked.  We ordered the large pizza but probably could've gotten away with the smaller size, since we ended up taking about half of it home.  The portion of the crust that wasn't covered in toppings was yummy and cooked well, but the crust underneath the toppings and olive oil sauce was a bit too thin and soggy - definitely couldn't eat the pizza without a fork and knife.  The quantity and quality of toppings was great for the price and the flavors were great, I just wish the crust had been a little more consistent throughout the whole pie.\n\nOverall this is a nice place to grab an outdoor bite along one of our three rivers, but I wouldn't necessarily say it's somewhere I will go out of my way to visit.", "user_id": "DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg", "business_id": "sbW8qHJgzEIH42B0S-3New"}
{"text": "Let me just say that this used to be a place I loved.\n\nRemember when you'd go somewhere and have good food, great service and a general pleasant experience and then a few months you'd go back and have it all again? Well one day you decide to go back and you realized everything has changed in a way that you can't describe and the place is no longer familiar. To me, that is Bar Louie\n\nI can't say the food is bad. I had an order of the pretzel sticks for an appetizer and the cinnamon sauce tasted like water and the pretzels were stale. I will say I still ate them so shame on me. My  sandwich (the Mario) as always was very good.\n\nNow here comes the bad:\n\n1. There were fruit flies EVERYWHERE.

I've played Diner Dash on my iPad, I know what happens when a place fills up too quickly when you are the only one working.\n\nIt's sad when a place you love turns into a place you never want to go again. I think I'm being very generous by giving it two stars but because I used to love it so much I can't rate it that low. Part of me hopes it gets better, but like an absentee father it'll just let me down again. I feel bad about giving this place such a meh review but every time I go that's exactly how I feel when I leave. Atria's is one of those places that I've never had any type of memorable service experience or food experience for that matter.\n\nI can't say the food is bad, but it's not really great either. I will say the service is always so. It's almost as if they don't realize you have other places to go; you can just sit at their restaurant all day. On the upside the busboy's and girls are hounding your table filling your water glass after taking a sip. So if you're a horse you won't go thirsty.\n\nHonestly though. you are better off eating the park. I mean who doesn't love Manny's BBQ? Located in 5th Avenue Place downtown, Cafe Amante definitely serves its purpose for a sit down eatery as it's the only true sit down restaurant in the building. It's nothing special, it's just there. The good is good the service is okay as well. It's just kind of there. Nothing is every special or changing there. I hate calling it regular but that's truly what it is.\n\nIf you're going for lunch look to spend about 10 bucks per meal and that's not including your beverage. It could be considered pricey depending on your lunchtime budget. I'm a fan of their chicken parmigiana. They also have a nice chopped salad. Plus free Breadworks rolls make everything better, right?\n\nI don't see it changing its ways anytime soon as the business travel through the place keeps it pretty steady. Why change what's no broken is probably what they're thinking, however, I really thinking the outdated decorations could really go. But if the boss man is paying, why am I complaining?", "user_id": "4q3czSXkHBPkW21RdzpJ2A", "business_id": "EoAY1JSVeJriBzId8lUQwQ"}
{"text": "I've had a pretty wide variety of experiences at Bar Louie.  Sometimes I go and the service is decent and the drinks are good, and sometimes I go and the service is really slow and the drinks are flat or just plain bad.  The one thing that is usually pretty consistent though is the food.  Any food that I have ordered has always been pretty good.  I've never had an amazing experience here, but I do still go back for food and drink specials and because of its location near the movie theater. I've been to Casbah several times now and each dinner experience has been even better than the last. I have tried several pastas, seafood, and meat dishes and not a single one has ever disappointed.  The aspect of Casbah that I feel sets it apart from even the other Big Burrito restaurants is its quality of service.  They are extremely polite, knowledgeable, and hard-working! I may have set my expectations too high, but I was a little disappointed by Olive or Twist.  After being unable to get reservations on 3 separate occasions, I finally dined here for food and drinks with my boyfriend on a Saturday night. We ordered the calamari to start, which was a solid choice, but nothing special. I ordered the Cajun tortellini and my boyfriend ordered the short ribs. I enjoyed my tortellini (it was a pretty large portion too), but my boyfriend wasn't crazy about the short ribs. We enjoyed our drinks, but they were on the pricey side.  I think if we were to come back, we would come during happy hour.  I feel like getting drinks and an appetizer slightly cheaper during happy hour would be the way to enjoy Olive or Twist the most. So I had previously visited olive or twist with my boyfriend a couple months back, and we were a bit underwhelmed.  I luckily decided to give it another chance.  My mom and I dined here before seeing a show.  We arrived at 6:20 on a Friday and luckily made it in time for happy hour, $5 glasses of wine and half price crispy kalettes for us! Our service was speedy (and very pleasant), so we were able to order second glasses before the special was over.  Our kalettes were very interesting! Crispy and cheesy, my favorite! I ordered the lobster mac and cheese and my mom ordered the poutine fries.  We both enjoyed our dishes and we shared, so I can vouch for both entrees when I say they're tasty and filling!  Perhaps our favorite part of the evening, however, was the banana caramel xango.  It was delicious and it was prepared so that it was perfect for sharing! The good: I dined here with my boyfriend before the symphony last night, and the food was delicious! The portions were large and the prices were very reasonable. I ordered the Virginia Spots with crab meat and broccoli and loved it! The house salad and balsamic vinegarette were very tasty...I would eat salads more often if I had that dressing at home. We ordered the zucchini fritti and the waitress was nice enough to warn us that the portions were huge and recommended a half order. My boyfriend ordered the crab cakes and green beans, he liked his meal too...I didn't try them but his green beans came with roasted red peppers and they looked so good! \nThe bad: I always order a vodka and cranberry when I go to restaurants, and I've never had any automatically assume I wanted top shelf (grey goose)...they've either asked what kind of vodka or given me the standard, so my drink almost cost as much as my meal. Not the biggest deal though.  I enjoyed my drinks.  The big downfall was the parking. The restaurant said that they validated the parking garage under the building, and the hostess gave us a ticket for the parking garage as soon as we walked in.  No explanation with it, so we assumed it was pretty straight forward, put it in the machine and go.  However, when we were leaving and put the ticket in the machine, it wouldn't accept it, so the attendant came over to help us.  We explained our situation, and he said we owed $15? If we had to pay any additional fees, one would think that either the restaurant or the ticket would have said so.  My boyfriend only had a $20, and the attendant didn't have any change of course so we paid $20 to park in that garage. One of the selling points of that restaurant when friends told us about it was that they validate parking. Had I known that was going to happen, we would have parked at one of the cheaper garages around the block.  Something to keep in mind for next time, I do still think that I will be returning.", "user_id": "RxEegiMllenlyhYgJqsTSQ", "business_id": "EoAY1JSVeJriBzId8lUQwQ"}
{"text": "This place was a total surprise to me. I didn't really know anything existed on Troy Hill aside from Penn Brewery until I went for a ride through the area this past weekend. While passing through I noticed Billy's, it was open, the steeler game was about to start.... Why not check it out?!\n\nThe interior is dated, but clean and has some character. You enter though the bar and the dining room is on your right, this being a Sunday afternoon though, the dining room was not open. No biggie, I'll saddle up to the bar which seats about 12 people. The bartender was very nice, introduced herself and wanted to get to know me. \n\nThis seems like a mostly locals only bar, but they are very happy when people from outside the neighborhood stop in. One thing I heard several times while I was in there was \"Troy Hill is getting better, more people should come here and find out.\"\n\nI tried the soup of the day, chicken and corn chowder, and an order of their wings, $.60 during the Steelers games. Both were very good and made me want to come back to try more of the menu. The beer selection is a bit limited, they mostly stick with the big name domestics, but that being said, the beer is pretty darn cheap. Sam Adams Octoberfest was $2.50 a glass or $12 a pitcher! \n\nI'll certainly be back to Billy's and I think you should go too, turns out there are things on Troy Hill! I guess for what it is, a thick crust with a canned tomatoes and uncooked mid/low grade cheese, it was fine. It's just not my style of pizza. They do have some of the hottest wings I have every eaten, the very aptly named \"after burners\". The sauce is very tasty with an INTENSE slow burn. A heavy hand touches everything at Mama Lucia's, unfortunately their generosity with toppings and serving sizes end up hurting the final product. I stopped in for lunch and ordered 2 slices (one with pepperoni and olives the other with mushrooms and sausage) and a side salad. Both slices were a nice size, however, the way they were served created an awkward eating situation. Rather than topping two individual slices they topped half of a 4 cut pizza to match my order. The slices were also an odd shape, essentially they were the chode of the pizza world (wider than they were long). This made it nearly impossible to pick them up and eat them by hand without getting sauce from ear to ear. They also violated my number 1 pizza sin and overloaded the slices with cheese. This made for a doughy center were the crust was slightly undercooked. \n\nTheir over loading of the cheese didn't stop at the pizza. My side salad came topped with an honest cup and a half of mozerella cheese. Underneath the white blanket there was a huge handful of red onion, a tomatoe slice, and some bland iceburg. On a positive note, they do make a great homemade vinegarette.\n\nEach day of the week they have a $3 lunch special. One of my co-workers always goes on Wednesday for their lasagna (a portion that may not fit in a shoe box). I'd try Mama Lucia's again for a sandwich or pasta, but I'm staying away from the pizza and salad. The guys over at Slice (http://slice.seriouseats.com/) have a theory called \"The Pizza Cognition Theory\" This theory states that one's pizza preferences are derived from their first truly memorable pizza experience. While our tastes may vary as we age, ultimately we are on a quest to recapture that first great pizza taste. \n\nVilla Reale is the place of my first great pizza memory (groan if you may but it's true). Growing up in Latrobe I had become accustomed to mediocre, chain pizza. Not until I was about 12 did I get my first taste of super thin, floppy, extra cheesy, greasier than normal pizza. This was the stuff I dreamed of. My dad took me here prior to my first ever Pens game. The Villa holds a soft spot in his heart as well due to the many many post work nights he spent here slugging beers and eating pizza with friends. \n\nFast forward 13 years and now I am the one working downtown, slugging beers and eating post work pizza. Unfortunately though, Villa Reale has become so expensive that treating it as a weekly stop is a bit unreasonable. While the pizza is still super thin, floppy, extra cheesy, greasier than normal, I have trouble paying $15 for a slice of pepperoni, a coke, and a side salad. On another occasion my dad requested to come here as his payment for helping me move. A medium calzone, a slice of pepperoni, and two cokes ran me $35. \n\nVilla Reale, please come to your senses and adjust your prices. While you played a significant role in my childhood, you are pricing yourself out of my adulthood.", "user_id": "OD1zfOrexwZoxJjTowGDfw", "business_id": "6AnorAMPkTdSDbUkOoV1Rw"}
{"text": "It wasn't a busy night at the neighborhood, but you could have been fooled by how long the food took.  While it did take a while everyone was extremely friendly.  The food did come out hot, at least mine did, the rest of the plates were plate-warmer hot.  Everyone in the table resented me for \"holding back\" the table since they staff pointed out they were waiting on my burger.\n\nWhich hey works as a segway onto the burger.  Quesadilla Burger.  I knew that was a mistake but I did it anyways.  The patty was sorta flavorful.  The toppings were in the bland category.  Cheese went MIA.  And the tortilla were over-toasted and tasteless.\n\nA big blah overall, which is sad, since we've had a grand ole time and good food in past visits. Standard Panera fair.\n\nThe difference maker (4 isntead of 3 stars) is that the staff at this one is nice. It has been a while since this place has been reviewed.  I'm happy to report the service isn't as ornery as some of the people experience in the past, so YAY for improvement.  I eat here a couple times each month since they have their Gas Crisis lunch menu entries.\n\nTheir sandwhiches always have fresh ingredients, and healthy portions of meat & cheeses in them.  The fries always come hot and not soggy, although sometimes I'm not a fan of their thicker cut selection for the fries.  I'm a shoestring width fry all the way kind of guy.\n\nTen bucks (tip included) got me a grilled cheese with bacon, double order of fries, and a drink.  I was in and out in 35 minutes (which was nice since I wanted to go for a walk) and the service was decent.  They aren't rude or dismissive but they're also not going out of their way to sprinkle petals as you walk about the premises.\n\nFor a quick decent meal at a good price, this place is certainly an option. This has to be the best diner setting Downtown, a complete archetypal flashback of the greasy spoon meal alternative.  I'm pretty much a regular (2x a week) now so I wanted to update my review to point out that they've made a couple changes (maybe a different food purveyor) and the food is even better now.  The bread is fresher than ever, the turkey is nice and tender, and the bacon is scrumptious.  Service is still that  \"make yourself at home\" but \"don't take yourself too seriously\" that I truly enjoy. Villa used to be really good and reasonably priced.  Ever since their facade renovation, addition of a ice cream machine, and maybe even date a little farther back ... the overall offerings are overpriced by about $2.00 per item on average.\n\nThe pizza is good, but if you order during rush hour you're in hit-or-miss territory for quality and temperature.  Hoagies are usually good regardless of how busy they are, it's just a matter of how long it'll take between ordering the hoagie and finally getting to eat said hoagie.  I haven't tried their salads or other dishes ... but for the most part I have heard nothing but positive reviews about their food.\n\nI've never been a huge fan of thin flimsy crusted pizzas ... so while nice sometimes, I continue looking for a nice thick slice of pizza that I can adopt as my \"go-to\" quick lunch in Downtown Pittsburgh. Update time:  How easy is it to win me back?  Remind me how good your hoagies are, that they're not overpriced like the Pizza is, and then serve me endless glasses of Coke Zero.  That's how!  Villa has regained a fan in me...good hoagies and Coke Zero...SWEET!", "user_id": "RDtp7XSLcvBt3AbOxjtYaA", "business_id": "OZfpG8tDCcIEq8pzgZdyKw"}
{"text": "Came here on a Monday night.  Boy was the place dead!  I was the only only Customer at 8:30PM.  Ordered a thin crust pizza with extra cheese, pepperoni and mushrooms.  It was pretty good.  Could of used more cheese.   I wasn't in the mood for the heavy crusted deep dish pizza. This is my first time at this location but have been to several of the other locations in the US.  It was just like the others.  The Caesar salad with anchovies was very good.  The service was very poor.  My waitress spent a lot of time chit-chatting with the hostess.  It was a chore to get water refills from her.  \n\nThey have big screen televisions in the bar area which can be seen from the restaurant. Surprised how empty the restaurant was tonight.   First time at this location.  Great service, but wasn't hard to do.....\n\nHad a combination Orange Shrimp and Chicken and Chicken Fried Rice.  It was typical PF Changs (Very good).  You can get the Fried Rice off the kids menu for $2.95 versus $8 for a big bowl off the regular menu. I have eaten there several times.  This is an overpriced overhyped seafood restaurant.  The portions are not worth the price.  The Sushi is average at best.  The service has been poor almost every time I went.  We complained once to the manager and in the middle of talking to her she picked up the phone and totally forgot she was talking to us.  \n\nThe salads are small and nothing to write about.  The decor needs to be updated. If you ask me why I keep going back; it's not by my choice.  Usually we have several people staying at the Westin. This is one of the most over hyped restaurant that I have ever been to.  I know it's a Pittsburgh legend. I have been there several times and every time say to myself, I won't be going back.  I only go there when dragged by coworkers.  \n\nThe restaurant is always packed, service is slow and you have to get up to get a drink refill from the cashier.  Yes it's unique having fries and cole slaw on your sandwiches, but the sandwiches are horrible.  Burnt Roast Beef or poor quality cheese steaks just don't cut it with me. My office often gets Pizza delivered from Monte Cello's. The crust is thin and the pizza is decent.  I have gone there a few times for lunch to grab a few slices of pizza (with others). I agree that the small fountain drinks with no refills is annoying.  If I am going to eat in, I prefer Villa Reale on Smithfield.  You can get slices during lunch if you sit at the counter. They must get patrons here in because of the could reviews from the other Tambellini restaurant or from being close to the theater district.  The food is pretty bad for an Italian restaurant.  The Chicken Parmigiana was very bready and I question if it was homemade.  I ordered a side salad and it was all iceberg lettuce.  The homemade bread was very sorry.....  Not worth the price.  The decor is very plain.  Service was fine. Decent pizza and calzones.  Get rid of the canned mushrooms! Crowded at lunch.  Calzones are huge! The canned mushrooms are gone!  Hurray!  Went back today for lunch for a pepperoni and mushroom Calzone.  It was huge!  The price was $12.25 which is a little high for lunch but it was very enjoyable.  The dough is very thick.  This is the best Calzone I have ever had.  It is filled with lots of cheese and toppings.", "user_id": "gwnVSev8aNLvMArs3WTfFw", "business_id": "6p9TlP2I8S4agxYMNFSDjg"}
{"text": "Where to begin, where to begin...\n\nMore often than not, I find myself staring at my computer screen thinking about how I am going to blast an esablishment. I don't rave about \"good\" food. I rave about amazing food. The type of food that I have dreams about. The type of food that makes me want to bring about a thousand dollars cash and gorge myself untill I need an ambulance.\n\nThe taco stand outside of Reyna Foods makes just that kind of food. Too often when we think of Mexican food, we think of a variety samey tasting, samey textured mixtures of ground beef, yellow cheese, beans, and tomatoes stuffed into a processed flour tortilla covered with a plastic sauce (I'm looking at you Emiliano's). Reyna's doesn't just break the mold, they hurl it at the wall, smash the pieces with a bat and then scatter the dust in a blast furnace. The tacos here are aboslutely amazing. Fresh ingredients cooked right there on an old plancha-style grill that has absorbed the flavors of countless meals and stuffed into fresh corn tortillas are a truly enlightening experience. I mean it. \n\nThe first time I went here was to just grab a quick snack while walking around in the Strip district. I saw they offered tongue as a protein choice and thought to myself \"What the hell, in for a dime in for a dollar right?\" Best. Choice. Ever. The first bite was like reaching the Seventh Level of Enlightenment. The Buddha said I could ask one question. After careful consideration I asked, \"Can I have another taco?\" After that I made a vow that I would forever be a loyal raving fan.\n\nThe tacos are assembled to your liking. I like mine with the works: the perfectly cooked meat on the warm tortilla then covered with queso fresco, tomatoes, lettuce, onion, cilantro, fresh lime juice, and sour cream. The flavors all play well together to strike a classical tune of a Mexican bolero on the pallate. As previously mentioned, I like the tongue. It has a wonderful richness and gameyness to it that I have come to love. My far less adventurous girlfriend stays with the chicken. They have other choices ranging from pork, to steak, to shrimp, to the ever popular ground beef (gotta please everyone I guess).\n\nAfter you order your tacos, try one of the fresh made flavored waters there. The fresh lime water is always my favorite, and is there every day, but they also have hibiscus, watermelon and other flavor selections. My girlfriend got the horchata, a milk based concoction with cinnamon, nutmeg and sugar. Or you could pop inside the Mexican grocery for a Coke hecho en Mexico. My favorite Coke because they use cane sugar, not HFCS.\n\nThe only downside is that they close right around 3:00 PM.\n\nCome to Reyna's. The tacos are amazing. Do I really need to say any more? As early 90's rapper Tone-Loc once said \"Let's do it.\"\n\nUnless you have spent your first 20 years or so in a subterranean nuclear fall out bunker, odds are you know of Ruth's Chris. The legendary steakhouse is supposedly the final word in steak outside of NYC and Texas. If this is the case then my oh my how the mighty have fallen. I have been to several Ruth's Chris locations around the PA, NY, and NJ area, but the one here in Market Square is truly a disappointment. \n\nWhen I go to a real steakhouse, like Peter Luger's, or the Old Homestead, or any other Ruth's Chris location I have visited, I expect to pay top dollar for top dollar steaks. I will never complain about the price so long as I feel as if the quality and quantity of food as well as the dining experience I recieve is fair in proportion to what I pay. The cheapest steak in the M2 Ruth's Chris will run you about thirty dollars. Normally, this would not be a problem had the establishment lived up to its reputation. Sadly, however, they did not.\n\nFirst, let's start with the decor. Ruth's Chris is a chain, first and foremost. That being said all locations are going to have the same basic look: old wood, magnum wine bottles, white tableclothes and red walls. I expect this sort of thing in a steakhouse. They are the last holdouts from the old industrial capitalist era. I feel as if I were to walk in, I might see Andrew Carneghie or John Rockefeller sitting at the bar discussing how unffair anti-trust legislation is.\n\nContinuing with the bar, Ruth's Chris offers a fantastic wine selection that has a pleasant mixture of affordable, yet quality, choices as well as a few that would cost me six months' rent. They also have a decent coctail menu, no doubt created by a corporate mixologist, that I must say is good. My girlfriend is not a fan because she can actually taste the alcohol in the majority of the concoctions, but I think that is a good thing. The bar is about the only place where you get the quality for the money you are spending.\n\nThe most dissappointing aspect about my last few visits have been the steaks. Ruth's Chris is known for basting their steaks in butter, which I do like. Fat is deliscious and that is proof enough for me that we are meant to eat it. This is where the goodness ends. On my second to last visit, a member of my party was served a rancid steak. The server tried to say it was dry-aged, but dry-aging does not produce a metallic, green beef. On my most recent visit, I was served a filet mignon that was tough. I have no idea how they were able to serve a tough portion of the least used muscle on the cow, but they did.\n\nAll of this brings me back to the service. I understand you are working in a fine dining, expensive steakhouse. I get that you throw down $300 plust dollar checks thirty or so times a night. I get that you are on first name basis with the Pens, Bucs, and Steelers that call themselves your regulars. That does not make me chop liver. I feel that if you are not wearing at least $3,000 worth of clothes or accessories, the staff will basically ignore you.\n\nThe saving grace to the place would be the bar and decor I already mentioned, and the sides. Ruth's Chris, like most fine dining establishments runs an a la carte menu. The sides are usually very very good. I like the sauteed mushrooms, sauteed spinache, lyonaise potatoes, macaroni and cheese, and the wedge salad.\n\nAll in all, this place gets a two in my book. I think that this is kind of sad given the fact that I was hoping to give them a five, but the quality of the food compared to what you pay just is not up to standard. For $250 I can feed and booze six friends at my house instead of me and my girlfriend at Ruth's Chris.", "user_id": "xMAkjQDQBH-N0EfhegaOXA", "business_id": "buVALudg30kgkDusqB3yJw"}
{"text": "This is a quiet little nook in Highland Park that is perfect for tea, coffee, snacks and getting some work done or catching up with an old friend. I used to frequent this place much more when I lived in Pittsburgh, but I still make an effort to come back a few times a year for the ambience. It is great in the summer and fall because they have a few tables outside.  The staff is great and the prices are reasonable, too. The only change I could think of would be to put on some soft easy listening music. It'd make the vibe a little more comfortable! Casbah is one of my favorite spots for an after-work drink or a romantic meal. The lighting and decor are very calming and inviting. The menu is refined Mediterranean with some modern twists. The waitstaff is attentive, timely, and always takes care of my food allergies. I always order sea bass or some sort of fish here, because they sear it to perfection. The chef actually made up their own side for my dish because I was allergic to the one on the menu. I received delicious crispy potatoes and sauteed arugula. Fantastic touch! They have a great wine list, as well. I would recommend Casbah to pretty much anyone, but it is especially nice for a one-on-one meal or a drink at the bar. Bado's is a quintessential Pittsburgh pizza stop. I may even consider it the best pizza in Pittsburgh! I hadn't been in since 2008 or so which was pre-food allergies for me. My friends got pizza and said it was the best they had had in a long, long time. I really don't think you can go wrong with any of the toppings.\n\nIf you've read some of my other reviews, you know I have 14 food allergies. This makes it almost impossible to dine anywhere, but when a restaurant feeds me with ease, I am a happy camper! They accommodated me with no problem and I had a delicious grilled chicken salad! I was very impressed.\n\nMy mom was not too keen on her bruschetta wedge salad, mainly because of the dressing (which is homemade, however I do love their homemade greek dressing!). She still managed to devour most of it, though!\n\nThe staff could have been a little friendlier, but they made a meal happen for me, so no complaints! Wonderful spot for lunch, drinks, and pre- or post-game fun. I've always had adequate, friendly service and great quality food.  My friends/family and I stick to the sandwiches and salads, but they have typical bar and grille fare with a Pittsburgh twist. It can seem a little pricey, but the quality is worth it, especially compared to other restaurants on the North Shore. It can be extremely crowded on game day, so make sure you get there early to get a spot at the bar, high-top tables, or in the dining room. They also have some outdoor seating if the weather is nice enough. Always top notch service and food at Ruth's Chris Pittsburgh. They have some summery specials during these cold winter months to bring you out of the post-holiday funk, which is very refreshing to see. Stop in for lunch for great deals on amazing food. Their lunch cuts of beef, chicken and fish include 2 sides and a salad for an extremely reasonable price. I got the lunch petite filet, veggies, mashed potatoes and appetizer salad for 28 bucks! Not bad for a steakhouse. Our server was incredible, as usual, and was extremely attentive of my gluten-free needs. The servers are extremely knowledgeable of the menu and will accommodate you no matter what. The decor is a bit dated and is due for a remodeling, but perhaps that will be on the list of things to do for the chain since they are celebrating their 25th anniversary this year!", "user_id": "JLS56V5lhErpFUjZ8N8VrA", "business_id": "83_p9vIqOq1TUIf3_GD7bA"}
{"text": "The food here is awful.  I came with a small group of people for dinner one night before heading out bar hopping at a few places at the Waterfront.  We gave the server the benefit of the doubt because there were about 8 of us, which can be challenging.  I think the long wait time to get the drinks and then the food was due to the bartender and kitchen, but the waitress really tried her best.\n\nI only gave it 2 stars because I liked my mac and cheese.  Everyone else at the table hated their food.  They all had sandwiches or other dishes.  The one girl resorted to eating only the toppings off her sandwich because the bread was too hard to bite through.  The kitchen probably made her sandwich right away and left it under the heating lamps for 40 minutes while preparing the rest of our table's food.\n\nI was tempted to stop and play games for a couple minutes, but after my husband came out of the restroom he told me how about 5 other guys walked out of the restroom as well that had not washed their hands and immediately went over to start playing games.  All I have to say is no thanks. I went with some work friends before catching a movie later that night.  We got to Bar Louie a little over 2 hours before the movie started, which left us with hardly any time to spare by the time we were done.  We had a table right away and the server took drink orders, but it took 15 minutes to get our drinks.  She then disappeared for 30 minutes before coming back to take a food order.  The food took almost an hour, and we had only ordered a couple appetizers.  The portions were really small for the price, and most of the food came out burnt.  I did not risk mentioning it at the thought of waiting another hour for new food.  Again, waiting for the server to bring the checks after the meal was an ordeal in itself and took much longer than it should have.  \n\nThe place was busy, but not overcrowded, what I would expect on a typical weeknight.  There is no excuse for the poor service and food.  On top of that, the restrooms were extremely filthy and clearly had not been stocked or cleaned recently.  Maybe it was just an off night for this place, but I do not plan on going back again and taking that chance. Although it's pricey, the food is definitely worth it.  My husband and I try to go here once or twice a year, either with a group or just the two of us.  We have never had a bad experience.  \n\nWhen we go here, we go all in - drinks, appetizers, desserts, all of it.  The crab cakes are delicious, as are the scallops they sometimes serve.  I am not even a steak person and hardly ever eat it, but I crave steak from Ruth's Chris because it is just that good.  I usually go for the petite filet, which they always cook to perfection.  If you love sweet things like I do, the sweet potato casserole is the best dinner side they have.  The desserts never disappoint either, I've tried almost all of them!\n\nYes it is very formal and what you would expect out of an older \"men's club\" steakhouse.  But hey, if I'm spending this kind of money, I want to be in a nice restaurant with excellent service!

Here's why:\n\n~ The Drive-Thru is crazy fast.\n~ There are 2 Drive-Thru lanes to keep it crazy fast.\n~ Even when they have to make my dog's special no-onion cheeseburger, they are crazy fast.\n~ For years, they gave my family's dog Jamie free baby ice cream cones. Jamie didn't need many moments of excitement to be happy, but 'go for ride' was one of them, and 'ice cream time' was another.\n~ The drive-thru staff is so sweet to my little pup Lucy when I take her to 'cheeseburger window'.\n\nSo, I guess what I'm saying is, this is the best McDonald's for dogs and their parents. And as someone who generally only visits McDonald's to reward my dog for good behavior after a vet visit, this McDonald's is just right. Have you met Frank? No? Well you'd better get on that, so you can brag to all your hipster friends that you know the best bartender in Pittsburgh.\n\nSeriously though. Best.\n\nWe found Papa J's at random on July 4th last year because, in typical Pittsburgh fashion, it was raining. We were en route from the Point to Station Square when the skies opened up, and the nearest bar to duck into was Papa J's.\n\nWhat you need to know first is that Papa J's is a historic landmark - it's the oldest standing former brothel in the 'Burgh. The wall behind the bar is actually fitted with a headboard (rumored to be that of the brothel madam), and there's a red light at the stairs.\n\nThe decor is all deep wood, low lighting, and mysterious feel. Better yet? Papa J's is rumored to be haunted.\n\n(Because if cocktails at a haunted former brothel doesn't get you excited about drinking in Pittsburgh, nothing will.)\n\nOh, and that's where Frank comes in. Frank is the friendly older gentleman behind the bar who will go out of his way to serve you the finest cocktails and martinis in downtown Pittsburgh. They've got a great house drink list (including a Bloody-Mary-esque beverage called the 'Angry Malkin'), but Frank also has a 'secret' list that only us 'real serious' Papa J's guests know about. \n\nFrank's policy is this: if you can give him the list of ingredients and he has them, he will make you any drink under the sun. If he makes it and you think it's great, he writes the recipe down in his notebook and recommends it to others. One of his specialties is the Black Eyed Susan. It's the signature drink of the Preakness, and he'll tell you the story of how he learned to make them (spoiler alert: it involves an A+ bartender going out of his way to help a sweet little old lady who loves the horses). \n\nAfter attending a Mixology class with Linda (that's Linda W. of Yelp fame!) where we made Prohibtion-era cocktails, I was in love with this gin drink called a Bee's Knees. It involves the use of honey syrup, which is not a common bar ingredient. Bless Frank's heart, he figured out some concoction of simple syrup and honey, and made me a Bee's Knees!\n\nYou can also choose to eat while at Papa J's, if you can tear your eyes away from all the drink menus. I recommend the bruschetta (almost always get an order of this - it's sooooo oniony, and sprinkled with cheese and a hefty serving of diced tomatoes - so good!), and any of the pizzas. Last time we stopped in, we had the chicken pesto pizza which had PINE NUTS on it!  PINE NUTS! (Those things are edging out beets as my favorite 'why-hello-there-how-did-you-get-on-the-menu' food in Pittsburgh restaurants lately.) The crust is perfect. I don't think I'll ever even try anything else on the menu, since I can't get past these awesome pizzas.\n\nSo, Papa J's is the perfect place to go if you want great booze and good food at decent prices in a neat atmosphere. They're in a great location downtown, and I've never had trouble getting a seat at the bar. I still haven't found any ghost activity, but as long as Frank is serving drinks, I'll certainly keep looking!", "user_id": "GnV8MNKEhHVl27bMVUuQTA", "business_id": "_jsJFrAmFVPRio0eEVExbA"}
{"text": "Local call this place Camps for short. If u like thin crust pizza , this place is for you . Try  the bacon pizza .. It's fantastic . Cash only place I live in walking distance so I have been here many times . The place is very clean and the menu has many choices ... Not just pizza and hoagies . The bar is well stocked and has many varieties of beer . I would suggest coming here for breakfast or brunch on the weekends . The omlettes are huge . The only drawback is the place very small and can get crowded . You can't have a discussion without hearing what the people sitting at the next table are talking about as well . There is sometimes a wait to get a table . Good place to take the family , a date or just yourself . This place is alot like Vincents of  Green Tree. It all depends on the chef who is performing for you . I have been here twice in last several months and felt everything was average . I have seen other chefs in different restaurants and they have put on a much better show . The food and service were very good . The food is made from scratch on premises . The restaurant is owned and run by two brothers from the Green Tree area . I admire this and always try to give my business to local family run places like this . My only gripes are the limited selection at the bar and I feel the prices for food are very expensive for the portions you receive. Nice, clean local place in Green Tree. Might be a little pricey but the food is good and homemade. Just read my review of Bados and you got this place . No breakfast here though but this place has two things Bado's doesn't . 1. a great deck to eat and drink 2. Free parking . Stopped in for a drink on new years eve . After experiecing several places for horrible service on the same day , this place was very refreshing . The bar was very crowded but the staff made sure that everyone who came in was waited on right away . Great service tops everything else . OMG what a nightmare. I was there last saturday at 9pm with a group of 10 people in the second floor bar area. The bartenders acted like it was a big inconvience that we were there. ordered drinks and didnt even get a thank you. the bar was dirty and littered with dirty glasses. The restrooms were filthy and didnt even have toliet paper . We left the bar and spent a HUGE anoun of money up the street.. I will never go back. Great place  . My favorite steak reaturant in Pittsburgh . The bar area could be bigger . The valet's were professional and quick . Stopped in for a quick drink on new years eve about 3 pm . The place was empty . The bartender Chris was rude and very vulger . He made a crude sexual comment as soon as we sat down . We decided to stay for a drink anyway . After going a couple of choices we were told the bar was out of most stock . On New Years Eve ??? The Bartender kept complaining about his job and bosses for the next 10 minutes . We paid for our drinks and got up and left . Might be the strangest employee experience I had in awhile .", "user_id": "mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA", "business_id": "Cex2R008tMFg8R5fAtf77w"}
{"text": "Pinos offers an unhappy marriage of good food at bad prices.  The food is tasty but not transcendent.  The prices in the high $20's for most of the entrees are not justified by the quality, location, or portions.  The food is essentially slightly hipper Olive Garden fare at double the prices.\n\nFor dinner entrees you can get more for your money elsewhere.  But it's not all bad.  The atmosphere is pleasant and the service was excellent.  I had a good time and I'd happily go back for appetizers (most are $8-10).\n\nPino's is frequented by a large rambunctious flock of malbec massacring 40-50 year old women.  My friend and I were the only males there.  If cougar hunting is your sport of choice, you'll feel right at home in Pino's jungle safari! The rave reviews I'd heard for Casbah were so over the top, I thought it would be impossible to live up to.   Casbah has exceeded it's sky high expectations and made me a believer!  We got the brunch and while the $24 pre-fix menu isn't cheap, it actually felt like a steal because the ambiance, decor, friendly attentive staff, and generous portions of delicious, inventive food were all so fantastic!  \n\nThe brunch pre-fix included your choice of breakfast cocktails, appetizer, entree, and amazing still steaming home made muffins and mint chocolate scones.  I'm anything but a light eater, and there was so much that I still had to take half my meal home!\n\nWe all got different things and there wasn't a single bite of anything that we didn't love.  I particularly recommend the Arugula salad, salmon and dill appetizer, and the scallop and grits entree, though you really can't go wrong.  \n\nThe decor and music was just as unique, artistic, and beautiful as the rest of the Big Burrito hot spots.  We ate in the basement, with a beautiful fully stocked glass wine cellar, under lit stone tile walls and wooden ceiling trim.  Casbah isn't cheap, but I'd still consider it once of the best values in the city  because you get so much for your money.  I'd trust Casbah to celebrate any special event with a flawless dining experience. It's got it's ups and downs.  It's got a reasonably attractive interior, antique tin ceilings, a broad selection of dozens of beers and a tasty looking menu featuring daily specials.  So why my low score?  D's at the other end of the block puts their beer collection to shame offering 1000 beers,  Both times I've eaten here the wait to be served has been extremely slow (at least 30 minutes and up) the prices are a bit high ($10-$15 for a lunch entree) and most importantly the food is in general heavy and bland.  This is not a terrible place, but with so many delicious spots nearby in regent square like the green mango, map room, d's and the square cafe you should keep on walking.  That said, if you wanted a quiet spot to grab a beer with a friend, you could definitely do worse, but skip the boring food. Delicious home made authentic italian classics.  Low prices.  Extremely generous portions.  For the same price as a Jimmy John's sandwich or Moe's Burrito, you can have a expertly prepared Italian feast with all fresh ingredients.\n\nWhy not a 5?  The service can be slow during the lunch rush, and the interior is a bit run down.  If you aren't in a crazy rush, your money won't go farther for better food anywhere in Market Square. I've had fish sandwiches all over Pittsburgh, it's a staple of the burgh diet and one of the dishes we do best.  Sadly Wiener World does it worst.  A bad fish sandwich in Pittsburgh is like bad BBQ in Texas or a bad cheesesteak in Philadelphia, an offensive abomination that denigrates the pride and reputation of the region.  I have never had a worse fish sandwich anywhere (including in fast food hole in the walls) and at $10, this assault on your taste buds doesn't come cheap.\n\nIt was bad in every way it could be bad.  Frozen, greasy, tasteless, heavy on bland batter and light on fish.  To add to it, even though the inside of the establishment is large, there are no chairs to sit down (just counters), they don't take cards (cash only, but they do have an atm) and the inside was freezing, I was shivering in the 60* temperature even though it was 80 outside in July.  \n\nSo why do they get 2 stars instead of just 1?  My server was very nice, the fries with the sandwich were prepared fresh and were good, and I've heard from many reputable sources that their ice cream is fantastic.  That said, I'll be licking my wounds from disappointment for a while before I lick their ice cream.", "user_id": "MA713-m2wv51bww8LN2fSA", "business_id": "ZL6DNzyenFm9Kpz6uADlNg"}
{"text": "This place used to have a great bar/tapas menu with a decent selection of happy hour wine specials.  Now...  not so much.  Well, during HH, you can get any of the wines under $10 for $5.  Selection by the glass is limited.  \n\nAs for their menu/dinner - this is totally a different story.  I haven't really been disappointed yet!  The appetizers/small plates all pretty good, I really like the chevre croquettes ($7).  The salads are good and although I haven't gotten the soup anytime lately, I hear great things from my friends.  The entrees are always excellent - I usually tend to stick to the seafood (halibut, $29) and never have been disappointed (and importantly, nothing has ever been overcooked).  The signature orecchiette dish ($20) is soooo delicious - just ignore the fact that it is a heart attack waiting to happen - it's worth it.  The desserts are ok, personally, I feel that you would be better advised to stick to filling up on the entrees.  \n\nOh, and let me recommend the blood orange martini if they have it - very very yummy!  And it is nice that you can order Veuve Cliquot by the glass ($16).\n\nPrices are a bit high for what you'd expect for Pittsburgh, but considering the quality of food, I would recommend it.\n\nP.S. I have heard that they have a great brunch on Sundays. I personally haven't tried it, but with the number of compliments I hear, it's probably worth the try!\n\n-------------------------\nUpdate 12/9/07:  Went to the brunch.  What a great deal!  For $22, you get a choice of alcoholic beverage (bloody mary, mimosa, bellini) as well as a starter and then the entree.  They have a lot of choices, so be prepared to just try one and come back again to try the other stuff!  The smoked salmon appetizer was good although with too much mayonnaise sauce and for me, too much onion.  The truffled potato was yummy.  The arugula salad was as delicious as ever!  And for entree, we both got the Casbah benedict.  I have to admit that neither of us was blown away, but it was good and filling.  I think that we will both be back to try other things on the menu! This place is no longer the cool hole-in-the-wall place to get a hot dog and beer (from a good selection).  They've expanded and that is both good and bad in my mind.  I liked the small, personal feel to the old place, but it definitely limited how many people who could be in the shop at a time.  So, now they have a much more extended seating area with a bar area and a back room devoted to brews.  I brought my friends here who like beer, and they were ecstatic to find a fave beer that they haven't been able to find anywhere in the DC area.  (Go Pittsburgh!).  The selection is nice and its good to see that I can find those out of the way beers so that I don't have to get just the norm from a beer distributor.  \n\nThe hot dogs?  None of us were gushing about them afterward.  But they're ok.  4 stars for the beer selection. This restaurant has remained - longer than I expected, frankly.  But the food is ok, definitely not great and is fairly forgettable.  The wine list is also forgettable.  Overall, this is a place that I go to if I have to for an event, but probably wouldn't think about otherwise.  It is well-located in the Strip District though and near some bars, so if you want to be able to walk from place to place, this is a place to consider if Italian is what you are in the mood for.  Fairly pricey for what they offer.", "user_id": "UzqOYLCssQS2FBcDq5HwkA", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}
{"text": "I went to Casbah for brunch, it's a $22 prix-fix, which includes an alcoholic bev, an appetizer and an entree. They use amazingly fresh and yummy fruits and veggies. I had the house made granola which was just amazing! Toasty and sweet, it was nothing like the granola you get out of a box. Also, while the food is totally fru-fru (in only the best way :) and it's a pricey brunch, you get a lot a food. After the great pastry basket, my appetizer, a Bellini and a cup of coffee, I had two bites of my omelette and took the rest in a doggy bag (\"the rest\" included fruit salad, potatoes, and a croissant!)\n\nMy only complaint would be how long everything took. While I love a leisurely meal, an hour and a half for brunch seemed a bit excessive. I go into brunch groggy, then I have coffee and yummy food, and I'm totally amped, ready to face the day! And then I get to sit. And wait. Anyway, it's totally not a big deal, now I'll know to make time the next time I go. Which is for dinner for a friends birthday. So excited!! So I went back to Casbah for dinner and was totally underwhelmed. The granola I had for brunch (in my previous review) was better than my entire dinner put together. The service was better at dinner then at brunch, but the food made my rating drop from five stars (probably a little generous) to three stars. Definitely go for brunch! But it's not worth the money for dinner. Mediocre food in a nice atmosphere with good service is still mediocre food... I looove Quiet Storm! It's a pain for the car less (me) to get to, and the service is fairly lacking, it's cash only with no convenient ATM's around, the closest business is a McDonald's half a mile away. And I still go there every chance I get. \n\nHipsters abound (pro or con, depending on who you are) and the place is REALLY child friendly (again, could be a pro or con). But generally, the crowd is mellow, reading, chatting, just enjoying.\n\nThe menu is designed in a way that they have something for everyone (except those adverse to eating healthy :). Between the veg and vegan options, they manage to have a menu that is fairly celiac friendly too, not an easy thing to do!\n\nA lot of the reviews here are about breakfast, which is amazing. But my favorite are their dinner salads. They're protein heavy, with a huge variety of ingredients, not your typical salads. And their specials, like tofu curry, are amazing, and always enough food for two.\n\nOh, and the drink menu! I'm pretty much a water, coffee, beer kind of person, so I haven't tried too much on it. But everything looks amazing. Quiet Storm is one of those places that doesn't do a wide variety of things, but what they do, they do damn well! I really want to give this place a good review, the decor is beautiful, the wine list is great (about ten $28 bottles, red and white, the pino grigio we had was phenom!), the service was fine, but the food was totally forgettable.\n\nThe service.... You know how when you get a jokey waiter when you're not \"that kind\" of table, you expect the waiter to get the hint and be more professional? Well I had the exact opposite experience. My very small office was saying goodbye to one of our coworkers, so we went to Lidia's for a boozy lunch. We were in high spirits and having a great time. The waiter was perfectly courteous and professional, but I thought he should have gotten that we were a more personable table. Anyway, I didn't knock off a star for this, it doesn't seem important enough. But it did taint my visit. I remember the waiters attitude more then some of the food.\n\nOh, and don't bother with the tiramisu, it's all cream, almost no cake.\n\nBut the atmosphere is great, they really went all out with the interior design. The menu isn't particularly veg friendly, but it's not too bad. Lidia's does high-end traditional Italian without being too pretentious or too predictable. But I have no desire to eat what I ordered (the daily special pasta trio) again nor do I have any interest in trying anything else on the menu. Months later I decided to lower my stars from four to two. I really wanted to like this place, but I really didn't.\n\nAnd I gotta talk about that wine list again, it's Lidia's only shining star. Of course, they have a pricey reserve list, but they have a whole bunch of really cheap, good bottles, and a bunch of wines by the glass too.", "user_id": "JF7Mnu-Zt2f9_E7b26TFgQ", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}
{"text": "Maybe Tazza D'Oro doesn't need another review, but I guess it never hurts to lend your voice to the chorus of those praising a good, solid and well-run local business.  \n\nThe coffee selection is terrific.  The baristas are professional and courteous.  No, they are not chatty, but they are polite and friendly.  I'm not there for conversation, but for good coffee.  And that's what you get.  \n\nThe pastries and snacks are fine.  Good variety.  \n\nThe atmosphere is JUST what I want when I need a cup of coffee: relatively quiet, comfortable and calming.  \n\nWhen it first opened (how long ago how?) it was mobbed by some of my neighbors (I live in Highland Park) who adopted it as their private club and often seemed peeved at \"others\" who stopped by.   They've either relaxed or found other obsessions.  The clientele is, as folks said, eclectic and invigorating.  \n\nIt's become our after-dinner spot after a meal at Park Bruges or Smiling Banana Leaf, too! Closed.  Signage down.  Boarded up tight.  Phone disconnected. Having read positive things about OFM lately, I thought we'd give it another try as it's been years since we've eaten there.  Unfortunately, our experience was dreadful.\n\nI knew going in that the food was overpriced.  Always has been.  But not only can you get less expensive fish/seafood elsewhere, but you also can get FRESHER food at other places.  Our food tasted frozen and overcooked.  \n\nWhat has NOT changed is the extremely poor service.  If you don't look wealthy or if you're not buying multiples rounds of alcohol, the wait staff avoids you.  And that was our experience the other night.  \n\nHow can restaurants get away with poor service and bland food at such high prices?  I guess OFM lives off the travelers and not the locals. 4.5 stars????   Really?????  Based on what?   The food is okay, but not great; standard breakfast diner fare.  The staff is friendly.  The prices are all right for what you get.  What I found most annoying was the uncomfortable seating.  The seats at the counter were torn and tilting off the base.  The booths were fast-food style: hard and tight.  It's as if they designed the seating to be uncomfortable so that you wouldn't linger. Another place that I visit once every few years thinking it couldn't be as bad as I remember it.  And the place NEVER lets me down; it's just as bad as I remember.  The seafood is breaded and fried to the point of inedible.  The staff is rude.  The prices are too high for the quality.  Just all around disappointing. You can count on ONE hand the restaurants that serve fresh food.  Honestly.  Lidia's is one of them.  Most restaurants in our fair city order supplies from \"food service\" companies; they come frozen and ready to \"heat and serve.\"   Or they're chain restaurants with pre-packaged meals (to \"protect the 'quality' of the product\") from the central \"food factory.\"   Lidia's?  All the food is hand-made from fresh ingredients in the kitchen of the restaurant.  And under the watchful eye of Lidia herself who seems to visit Pittsburgh quite often to maintain quality control.  \n\nI adore the frico and the pasta trio offerings.  The salads are fresh and vibrant.  And the \"under $30\" wine list is a blessing.  Over the years, I've had most of what's offered on the menu and I've NEVER been disappointed by either the quality of the food or the price.  And the portions are generous.  \n\nIf that's not enough, the staff -- host/hostesses, servers, bartenders, mgmt -- are first-rate: friendly, responsive and on-the-mark.  One night, my wife and I stopped by simply to have drinks and appetizers. We sat at the bar and began to chat with the bartender about wine.  We ended up tasting several red wines and learning about some terrific wines priced under $20 at the state liquor store.  What a resource HE turned out to be!\n\nMy only warning: holidays can be tough at Lidia's: Valentine's Day, Easter, Mother's Day, New Year's Eve, etc.   They usually have a fixed-price menu offering those days and they tend to be overwhelmed by the number of people who come to eat there.  The service and the food quality suffers as a result.  My advice?  Avoid the holidays and stop by on a weeknight for a dinner experience unlike you've ever had.   Linger and enjoy the desserts.  Soak in the atmosphere.  Chat with the staff.  \n\nStill the best restaurant in Pittsburgh.  No doubt about it.", "user_id": "7xH9Qey07WJYq5E1sFxo_g", "business_id": "83_p9vIqOq1TUIf3_GD7bA"}
{"text": "Why is this restaurant called SoHo? \n\nIs it an effort to capture the artsy-fartsy joie de vivre of Manhattan's neighborhood's namesake? Lord, I hope not. The restaurant is located across from PNC Park in just about the least artsy-fartsy neighborhood of Pittsburgh. But I guess Post-Game Drunken Fratboy Hangout doesn't really have a good ring to it.\n\nIs it a nod to Pittsburgh's very own SoHo? Lord, I hope not. The restaurant has far more glam than the rundown neighborhood trapped between Duquesne University and South Oakland. But I guess Depressing Shithole doesn't have a good ring to it, either.\n\nWhatever the story behind its namesake is a moot point upon experiencing the restaurant's fare. Here's what you can expect:\n\n1. Meh food. The SoHo steak and cheese is essentially chopped steak and Cheez Whiz on a bun. It's not particularly delicious. The fries were good, though.\n\n2. Outstanding drinks. Perfectly priced, elegantly presented, and expertly mixed. The Cinnamon Toast Crunch martini is ridiculously delicious. Honest to God, it tastes like a friggin' bowl of the cereal. Except with alcohol.\n\nIf you're in the North Side, go for a cocktail during Happy Hour, but don't schlep out for a special trip or for a memorable meal. You won't find it here. My dearest Lidia,\n\nHello! How are you? How's Manhattan? Is PBS treating you well? Is your wallet getting fatter by the second? I hope so. \n\nI finally dropped by your restaurant in Pittsburgh's Strip District this evening. I know you've been begging me to check it out for years, but quite frankly, I just haven't been in the mood for pasta. You know how I am... carbs and all. \n\nYou know, I must give you props for the restaurant's layout. The fancy wall art, the color of the paint... I must say Rockwell did a very good job, and watching the sun set over the Allegheny River while dining on our meal was simply delightful. \n\nAt the behest of our server, each of my dining companions and I ordered the prix fixe pasta and a few antipasti. The antipasti were lovely - the lightly seasoned calamari was divine and the fresh mozzarella and olive platter was splendid. A terrific way to start the meal.\n\nNow Lidia, I know you'll never indulge me, but what on earth is in the dressing on your Caesar salad? It's smashing! There's definitely a hint of pear in it, but other than that, I'm flummoxed. Oh, and the imported cheese really bolstered the salad, sending a usually ho-hum affair into the stratosphere. You've really outdone yourself, my dear. \n\nAnd then came the prix fixe pasta trio. Lidia, darling, you know I'm a fan, but it really wasn't your best effort. The imported eggplant was overpowered by the tomato sauce, and the broccoli and sausage rabe was good but not great. Only the goat cheese-stuffed ravioli was better than average, but just marginally. Our server informed us that the ravioli was infused with thyme, but spank my bottom if I didn't taste a thing! Over all, not your best showing. \n\nDessert was quite sterling - the strawberry panna cotta was perfectly prepared, although a bit much with the cookies. Really, who has room for all that. I know you chide me constantly with your incessant \"mangia, Joe, mangia!\", but I had really eaten far too much and the champagne had gone to my head as well. \n\nSo there you have it: my visit to your restaurant in Pittsburgh. Not quite five stars, but certainly not 3 stars. I'll give you a four this time, if only for the blandness of the prix fixe. Do give my love to Joseph and don't be a stranger.

{"text": "For our last lunch in Pittsburgh we decided to return to the Big Burrito Group; Eleven was quite good and both Gayot and Pittsburgh Magazine compared the experience at Casbah favorably to that of Big Burrito's crown jewel.  Citing a mix of Mediterranean and Northern African influences with a bargain Piccola Gusto Menu for lunch and the option for indoor or al fresco dining it seemed as if Casbah was a can't miss option...well, sometimes things don't turn out quite as you expect - almost everything that transpired from the moment we arrived until the moment we left was a failure.\n\nWhen our server, a young woman named Amanda L who would prove quite inept and inefficient from start to finish, finally did arrive our menus were delivered with a brief hello before she wandered away - another server later stopped by to fill our water and drinks were never even offered.  When Amanda finally did return she was capable of answering a couple questions about portion size and our orders were placed.  With my mom and sister opting for the two-course Gusto lunch and myself choosing two courses a la carte we sat and sipped our water.\n\nWaiting approximately 10 minutes another ancillary server arrived with bread and butter - a light and airy white bread with a hefty crust paired with a sweet and salted cow's milk butter - decent, but nothing to write home about compared to the myriad bread options at Eleven.  After this point we would not see another staff member for 30 minutes...well, we would see them, they just wouldn't be walking anywhere near our table - instead bussing tables and running around while the hostess flirted with a man at the bar...I'll note that my water glass remained empty for greater than 15 minutes.\n\nFinished with our first courses approximately 10 minutes would pass - long enough for me to actively collect each and every plate and stack them at the empty seat of our four-top - before Amanda would finally return to collect the dirty plates...we'd not see her again until 15 minutes later when she filled our water glasses and told us our main courses would be \"right out.\"  While I guess she didn't define \"right out,\" what this actually meant was \"in 25 minutes.\"  Starting first with my mother's combo - Jumbo Lump Crab, pepper bacon, avocado, radish sprouts, on a paesano bun and Orecchiette Pasta with grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Riverview Farms goat cheese, sage cream. While the sandwich may not be memorable, the pasta was actually quite impressive.  Using a less salty cheese and mild cream to flavor the al dente little ears of pasta worked wonders while the sweet/savory m\u00e9lange of craisins and grilled chicken were a nice match.\n\nVastly less well done than my mother's plate would be my sister's option - the Grilled Vegetables, portobello, zucchini, eggplant, arugula, chickpea hummus, on baguette and Maccheretto pasta with wild mushrooms, white beans, sun-dried tomatoes, rapini pesto, fontina, walnuts.  Beginning with the sandwich, the bite I had was good in taste but rather mushy in consistency - too many similar vegetable textures and the hummus spread too thickly.  Moving on to the pasta - we all tasted it, but I'm still not sure what we were supposed to be tasting - it tasted like watery cheese...no spice, no salt, and certainly nothing resembling pesto or tomatoes.  For the first time in the meal Amanda actually opted to check on us approximately 10 minutes into our main courses and when told of the watery pasta she did apologize and offered to replace it with something else - more Orcchiette.\n\nFor my main course I received a simple side salad-fresh greens, crispy onion strings, and a pleasant vinaigrette.  The salad, of course, was served alongside Elysian Fields Lamb \"Mac and Cheese\", tubetti pasta, mascarpone, cheddar, Pecorino-Romano, and bread crumbs.  Piping hot and browned with crispy bread crumbs the dish was a decent Macaroni and Cheese, but honestly the lamb was so scarce and thinly cut that it added little.\n\nCompleting our mains approximately 110 minutes after entering Casbah we again waited nearly ten minutes before anyone would stop by to collect dirty plates-a different ancillary server this time.  With my mother and sister already deciding enough was enough they stood up to use the restroom before leaving-by the time Amanda would stop by to ask if anyone would care for dessert our two course meal had lasted 2:05 and I skipped on a menu entailing bread pudding, carrot cake, and panna cotta with \"just the bill.\"\n\nSettling the bill via credit card no tip was left because no tip was deserved - in reality Amanda may have actually be the worst server I've encountered at a fine dining establishment in the last 2 years.  I will note that when I wrote to Big Burrito was met by a (seemingly) sincere apology without excuses - the Manager stated things don't' normally happen like that and he'd be sure the issue was addressed.  He closed with \"I hope you will join us again.\" I will not. Arriving at the midpoint of the lunch hour we were surprised to find the restaurant less than 1/4 full.  With the bar empty and only one section being seated be claimed our reservation and were led quickly to a table near the large glass windows - an excellent view of the river would be our companion throughout the meal.  Meeting our waiter, a friendly man named Chendo we were given menus and a brief explanation of the daily special pastas for the Pasta Trio.  With the restaurant quite slow that day I will note we were very well taken care of throughout out meal - the service staff was excellent.\n\nBrowsing the high ceilinged room, randomly placed bottles and objects, and abundant brightly colored glass panels plus Chihuily influenced chandeliers I have to say Lidia's is a very handsome restaurant - it has that \"wow\" factor of many New York City dining rooms.  While the white paper over white tablecloth aspect of the table setting struck me as odd, everything else felt \"fine dining\" without seeming forced.\n\nSitting and waiting for our meals to arrive we were first delivered one of the better bread baskets I've had in recent memory - Sea Salt Foccacia, Rustic Italian, and Cracked Wheat Sourdough served with two spreads, a Chick Pea Pesto and pureed White Beans with Black Olive, both resting in a pool of slightly sweet extra virgin olive oil.  Served warm the breads were tantalizing and given the size of the portions soon to be arriving it was definitely a chore not to overindulge (a chore I failed, miserably.)\n\nFor our main courses my mother opted for a salad and a contorti while Erika and I chose pastas.  For myselfthe choice was quite simple - my favorite pasta and my favorite protein on the same plate, Gnocchi with Duck Guazetto.  An Italian Stew not unlike Chicken Cacciatore, but featuring duck in white wine instead of Chicken in Red the thick reduction was hearty, meaty, smoky, and laden with vegetables.  Paired with a toothsome yet non-doughy potato gnocchi the dish was not only enormous, but incredibly filling.  While I will admit I ate a lot of bread and helped my mother and sister  with their plates I can say that this was one dish I couldn't finish, it was just too large.\n\nFor Mother's selection she opted for the Roasted Beet and Apple Salad with Frisee and Fresh Goat Cheese plus the Pan Seared Golden Polenta Fritters.  A competent salad with sweet apples balancing earthy beets and pungent goat cheese the dish was brought together by a splash of balsamic and olive oil, ample in size and flavor, very nicely done.  Not fairing quite as well as the Salad were the Fritters - nicely prepared and crispy on the outside with creamy polenta within, they simply lacked flavor.\n\nErika's selection would be the signature Pasta Trio - three pastas plated tableside with unlimited refills.  Admittedly the concept sounds somewhat \"Olive Garden\" but that is before you realize two of the pastas are made in house and one is imported direct from Italy...and all the sauces are made daily in the kitchen, as well.  Served up onto a single large platter the daily selections  would be hand torn Tagliatelle and Pork Ragu, Imported Orchiette with Fennel Sausage and Thyme, and house folded Sweet Pea and Corn Ravioli with Cream Sauce.  Enormous in portion I cannot really fathom anyone requiring seconds of the trio and at a mere $14 the selections were excellent.  Smoky and Sweet the Pork Ragu complimented the al dente Tagliatelle nicely while the aromatic sausage was an equally balanced flavor for the Orchiette.  The most impressive of the group, the sweet pea and corn ravioli, was sweetened only by the vegetal components while the cream itself had notes of cinnamon and nutmeg.\n\nArriving simultaneously and thankfully smaller than the entrees was Torta di Mandorle e Mirtilli - Blueberry and almond cake, blueberry-lavender ice cream, almond crunch, blueberries. .  If a little is good a lot is better seemed to be the theme of this dessert and it worked nicely - the fresh blueberries lacing the buttery pound cake, the flowery accent to the blueberry ice cream, and the crunchy sugared almonds paired with even more blueberries - excellent.\n\nThe second dessert, larger in size but lighter in texture, would be Panna Cotta alla Fragola - Strawberry and ricotta panna cottas, lemon-strawberry sandwich cookies, fresh strawberries.  Served in a 12oz glass better suited for a milkshake the panna cotta was surprisingly springy and well blended with a more gelatin strawberry base topped by an ample creamy layer of whipped cream and ricotta.  Unnecessary but welcomed the lemony cookies were much akin to a shortbread in texture and Madeline in flavor.\n\nHaving heard \"upscale Olive Garden\" comparisons I personally find that assessment far from accurate and would actually go so far as to say that aside from the lack of seasoning the the experience was on par with many fine dining Italian establishments in other cities.", "user_id": "5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}
{"text": "Passed this restaurant for years on my way to Buffalo Blues or more recently Mad Mex but have never actually eaten here.  Having finally come for lunch, I overall enjoyed it but it had some ups and some downs.  \n\nI ordered the Piccola Gusto Menu which for me included the Cream of Cauliflower soup, the Orecchiette Pasta and the Roasted Turkey Sandwich.  It sounds like a lot of food but the pasta serving is mini and it's a half sandwich.  For me, the size was just right.  The soup was awesome, and I could have eaten an entire lunch of just it.  The pasta was a little too creamy for me and just didn't have enough seasoning or spice.  I did love the addition of the cranberries in it though.  The perfect amount of sweet to offset the cream.  The roast turkey sandwich was just that.  Not out of this world, but not bad.  My biggest complaint was the service.  It took a really long time to get our meals which is always a bad thing during a weekday lunch.  \n\nI'd like to go back here for a happy hour when it's warm so I can enjoy the covered patio though and a nice glass of wine! How have I never been here before?  How have I never even heard of Legends?  No more.   I went here for lunch and it was delicious!  The location = little scary, especially if you would go at night.  The atmosphere = not top notch.  The food = excellent.   \n\nI was very pleasantly surprised with my entire meal.  The bread with the rosemary dipping oil was quite good.  The salad was also very tasty.  It had blue cheese and roasted red peppers which I can't get enough of and no iceberg lettuce in sight.  I opted for the spinach and ricotta ravioli in a basil tomato cream sauce.  It was very good.   Not the best I've ever had but solid.  Lots of sauce to dip more of the tasty bread in.   Did I let it end there?  Of course, not.  I had a giant slice of apple pie with ice cream.  The apples were sliced a little too thickly for my liking but it was a darn good slice of apple pie and that's coming from someone who makes an out of this world homemade apple pie.\n\nNeedless to say, I didn't get much work done that afternoon because I could barely move. When your favorite drink always involves vodka, then this is your place.  They have the best selection of martini's in the Burgh.  Whether you love them sweet, dirty, or like a dessert in a glass, you'll find a favorite.  My biggest problem is that I've found one too many favorties.  While the martini's are delish, I'm not as big a fan of the food.  The buffalo chicken spread appetizer is great for happy hour but I just didn't love the other items I've tried and the entrees aren't memorable.  I recently discovered the upstairs lounge and it was comfortable and spacious (much more so than the crowded downstairs bar).   If you work downtown and you haven't stopped here for happy hour, you are missing out! Order the pasta trio and you can't go wrong! I looove to go here for lunch and get the pasta trio. For lunch, you get unlimited servings of three different pastas (one of which is imported from Italy) brought out fresh and served table-side from the skillet plus soup or salad for $14. Their Caesar salad is delicious and they offer some unique soups which are a refreshing change from the normal wedding soup or minestrone. It might be on the high side for lunch but it's well worth it!   Warning:  you may want to nap when you get back to your desk.  They also serve fresh breads with spreads. I prefer the green spread which is a bean base and contains who knows what else. The dinner pasta trio is a little more expensive ($18 for just the pasta or $29.50 w/salad, trio and dessert). \n\nI've had soooo many different pastas there, I couldn't begin to name them all. Some of my favorites include the pear ravioli, goat cheese ravioli, penne a la vodka, penne arrabiata, gnocchi in a Gorgonzola sauce and the list continues. They typically serve one pasta that contains meat and two meatless pastas but they'll make a third meatless pasta for all those vegetarians out there. I don't typically order off the menu but I've had the salmon and been pleased. \n\nI also recommend their brunch. It's $25 per person and includes a variety of anti pasta (probably a rotating sample of 10 or so that includes anything from soup, Caesar salad, various other salads, meat trays, bean based dishes, marinated vegetables, quiche, etc), fresh breads with an assortment of flavored butters (strawberry jam butter is my fav), one mimosa or bloody mary, the pasta trio or some other entree, coffee or tea, and a table full of various desserts for sampling. You can't go wrong. We go here for brunch when family is visiting and everybody looooves it! I recommend making a reservation for brunch. \n\nThey don't rush you through your meal which means that service can be a little slower than your typical restaurant but with the pasta trio in your future, you won't regret it.", "user_id": "xSyjJmHMYyoutsNznUWTqw", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}
{"text": "Got lunch from here today. \n\nWhat I sampled: \nMaine Lobster Bisque (delicious and the whole reason for getting lunch from here)\nCheeseburger (decent version I only ate about half, but I expect the other half won't last long)\n\nOverall I enjoy going here, though it is a bit overpriced, but sometimes I am just in the mood for that lobster bisque! Went here with a gift card from the restaurant week photo competition. \n\nWe were one of two tables there and a bunch of staff showing up during the meal. \n\nOur waitress was good, but that couldn't save the food.\n\nThe meal started out with some what I guess used to be foccacia.  I say used to be because it no longer represented anything other than long pieces of brick or bark very stale and tasteless.\n\nWe ordered the vegetable board which was probably the best thing we ordered with light and bright vegetables perfectly cooked and paired with two delicious sauces. \n\nThen we ordered the octopus which was fine, but very cold and the octopus had little to no flavor, being overwhelmed by the citrus in the dish. \n\nThe tuscan wings were ok, but they were really ordered for my husband who seemed to enjoy them. \n\nFinally the diver scallops.  This dish was indeible.  The scallops were very overcooked and the pea puree was so minty I was unable to eat it. We sent it back and they did take off half of the price (weren't expecting anything just didn't want to eat it). \n\nAfter that we decided against dessert and left.  I probably will not return. Went here last night for takeout since our normal place is currently renovating their kitchen. \n\nWe ordered fried dumplings which were just ok. We also ordered some shrimp lo mein and general tsos chicken. These were some of the best entrees that I have gotten from a takeout place. The lo mein was perfectly cooked and was not greasy at all. The shrimp were also cooked perfectly. The general tsos may be some of my favorite I have ever gotten. It wasn't spicy like I requested, but the chicken was still crispy after having to drive it home and the sauce was very savory. \n\nOverall I probably will crave the food from here and will be back, on a night when I do not mind driving to pick up. Went here for drinks with some friends.  \n\nThe bar service was definitely interesting.  Some of the time the waitress was really on point and was there ready to take your drink orders, but after the first drink it was really hard to get a second. \n\nI can't speak for the food, but will update my review when I get back to try the food.  Overall my dirty martini was good, though it definitely could have used some better quality olives (these were bottled with the red pepper on the inside used on salads).  I will definitely be back to try the food, but I hope the table service is better than the bar service. Went here for brunch yesterday. \n\nWhat we sampled: \nMimosa (I don't like mimosas, but this was delicious with fresh squeezed orange juice)\nBread basket (sea salt foccacia (delicious) cranberry and almond scones (delicious, but very crumbly which the fiance found out the hard way) strawberry butter, sugar butter, and honey butter)\nAntipasta table (overall good selection, but a little bland, the only memorable thing on the table for us was the Cesar salad, which was delicious, but a tad overdressed) \nEntree (we both ordered the pasta trio.  The three choices were penne with onions, sausage, and tomato ragu (the least favorite), Homemae fettucine aglio e olio with tomatoes and butternut squash (delicious and very fresh tasting for the fall), and homemade mushroom ravioli in a thyme butter sauce (the best selection by far and completely delicious)\nDessert table (good selections with standouts being the tiramisu and the chocolate torte)\n\nOverall this was a great brunch experience for the price as well as the selections.  We would definitely return.", "user_id": "tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A", "business_id": "usSROUMiAgPcxV3Ym0OxMQ"}
{"text": "DRINKS: Water for me, Yuengling for my fiance\nAPPETIZERS: Cup of Maine Lobster Bisque for me -- soo good! My fiance had the New Orleans Seafood Gumbo which I had a taste of it and it was good, but I liked my soup better...very rich and creamy but full of flavor with a fair amount of lobster bits mixed in. The bread they served with the apps was fresh baked (I believe sourdough) and it was quite tasty along with the whipped butter. Our entrees came with house salads - had great elements, but I felt I couldn't enjoy mine because the dressing given was a poppyseed vinagrette and I can't handle too much acidity in my food these days. My fiance however cleaned his salad plate (not a sentence I utter often).\nENTREES: I had one of the specials, Grilled Shrimp and Scallops with roasted summer vegetables and tomato vinagrette (which I asked for on the side). The seafood part was great - the vegetables were so-so. My fiance had the special of Cod stuffed with Lobster (and some other seafood) with asparagus and a lemony sauce - I had a taste of his and it was really yummy, I'll def order that next time! We both finished our plates, which wasn't too challenging b/c the portions were moderate (I got 3  srhimp and 3 scallops for example) but still filling.\nDESSERT: Didn't order any\nSERVICE: Friendly, though a little sparse. After we finished our meals we felt like we were waiting around for awhile before we could ask for our check. But our server was overall friendly and we didn't feel neglected or anything.\nDEALS/DISCOUNTS: None\nOVERALL: We liked the variety and freshness of seafood. Def a place we'd consider going to again, which is the main mark of a very good experience! Had dinner here on a Saturday night. Actually, wanted to go to Piccolo Forno, but they said they only take reservations for groups of 6 or more and for two of us there might be a half our wait. We wanted a sure, immediate thing so we decided to try Lidia's.\n\nDRINKS: My husband had the cabernet and said it was fine, nothing spectacular but def what you'd expect from a cabernet. I had their Prosecco. It was good, not as sweet as I'd like, but still tasty.\n\nAPPETIZERS: We didn't order any dishes intended to be appetizers (you'll read what I mean), but we did enjoy the basket of bread and unique spreads (garbanzo and something, olive and something) that came with tit. The bread was not straight out of the oven, but it was definitely fresh-baked that day.\n\nENTREES: I ordered 2 appetizers instead of an entree. The first was the octopus dish, and it was THE BEST OCTOPUS I'VE EVER HAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Tasted like what it was but without being too briney/fishy. Also had a great texture. And the other items in the dish (capers, etc) complimented it really well. I don't use the word delicious that often, and I use delish even less often. But that was deliciously delish. \nMy 2nd appetizer-turned-entree was the cheese crisp. It was tasty, but super heavy. I chose the crab and scallion filling for that one, which was nice, but I think the whole cheese crisp idea (essentially cheese melted down to a \"cracker\") did not suit me. After a few bites I decided to pack the rest, but haven't eaten much of the leftovers.\nMy husband tried the pasta trio (unlimited) and liked it, though he didn't rave about it. I think there was a spinach ravioi, some type of alfredo linguine, and a pesto with meat and a red sauce, so there was a good texture/flavor variety from what I could see on his plate. He ate two full plates of the variety of pastas and was stuffed!\n\nDESSERT: We shared the Tiramisu. It was very fresh and authentic tasting. I felt like there was a bit too much espresso/coffee powder sprinkled on top, but perhaps my palate is sensitive to that. Overall it was yummy.\n\nSERVICE: Friendly and attentive.  \n\nDEALS/DISCOUNTS: None\n\nOVERALL: Glad we tried it. I would like to try the other well-rated Italian restaurants in Greater Pittsburgh, but I have a feeling I'll go back to Lidia's someday for that octopus -- so freakin' good!", "user_id": "EoItAkP58vSnG_-ZhJI8pA", "business_id": "usSROUMiAgPcxV3Ym0OxMQ"}
{"text": "This is the kind of restaurant that I deeply appreciate.  Family-owned.  Off the main roads.  Charming interior.  Unique staff.  WONDERFUL FOOD.  (We called this our \"less-expensive Casbah\" when we left).\n\nLike everywhere we end up going, we go because a Yelp review we have read, that inspired us to give it a try.  We new it was BYOB, but we weren't in the mood for drinking, so we walked on over.  It was our own fault that we got there, at 5:00pm, on the dot - and they were not quite ready to be opened, as they were finishing setting up the tables.  My boyfriend and I took a quick walk around Ellsworth.  It's a family-owned business where they turned their front garage into the most charming, artsy-like, romantic restaurant.  We'll cut them some slack!\n\nWhen we got back, they were ready for us; and we chose to snag a table outside (they thought we were nuts).  However, in one of the reviews, we read that they had no A/C, which was a big selling point for us (I absolutely loathe going into a freezing cold, A/C'd out restaurant, and being forced to bring a hoodie with me, when it's 90+ outside.  And we do kind of like hot, humid, and muggy); but, I guess they have upgraded because the A/C was BLASTING on the inside of the restaurant.\n\nWe started off with the Gazpacho.  This was a perfect summer starter because it was cool, extremely flavorful, and a natural air conditioner to the body.  It had lumps of shrimp and crab meat at the bottom, which made us feel like we were eating somewhere on Duval St. in Key West.  I normally don't like cilantro, but the cilantro was so subtle and completely rounded out the flavor.  When our waitress brought out the freshly baked loaf of corn bread, we sopped up the rest of it.  It is true, the wait staff genuinely appreciates your compliments and feels honored every time you say you enjoyed something.\n\nI ordered the Wild Mushroom Ravioli and my boyfriend ordered the Lamb Burger.  When our dishes came out, they were the most beautiful dishes I had ever seen - full of color, wonderful portion sizing, and aromas just attacking the olfactory with sensational goodness.  My Ravs were topped with this grape tomato paquillo sauce, which tasted like it had hints of red pepper also.  It was FANTASTIC.  Plus, there were whole mushrooms, okra, carrots, and cauliflower on top of the dish as well.  I don't know what kind of separate seasonings were on the veggies, but they were to-die-for also.  I can't exactly remember how many Ravs were in my bowl, but every time I thought I was finished, there was another ravioli to be found, and then another.  For the price - I think there were a total of 10 fully-stuffed, hand-made mushroom ravs.  Incredible.\n\nMy boyfriend's Lamb Burger came with a cranberry and raisin jam (but \"jam\" seems to clich\u00e9 of a word for this topping), and a salad that had slices of apples in it.  Now I'm usually not one to eat sweeter tasting foods; however, the complementing of sweet and savory in this dish blew my mind.  I'm also not a big fruit eater (unless it's blended in a smoothie), but I totally got past all that because the flavors and the textures all are playing nicely with one another.\n\nWe opted out of dessert because we were so stuffed.  But our bill for an appetizer and two filling, insanely delicious entrees came to $40.  DING DING DING DING DING!  WE HAVE FOUND A WINNER!  \n\nAfter dinner the owner came over to our table and we were introduced.  What a wonderful, sweet, and genuine older guy.  We will definitely be back before the menu changes again; and next time, we're going for entrees and dessert!! \n\nOne last thing - it is a Cash Only restaurant, but they do have an ATM on-site. More like 3.5 after being at Salt of the Earth.  But Still - Lidia's is one of the few restaurants on mine and Jordan's list, where one of us has been employed, but we will still willingly eat at.  Lidia's is our choice when we want great Italian foods that taste as close to our family making it as possible.\nThe other night we went for drinks and apps at the bar.  This is always fun for us because the Fritto Misto is fried veggies and calamari in a light batter, with their sauce for dipping.  And Lidia is the queen of sauce recipes!  We also had the appetizer version of the pasta-tasting platter because there is no way to walk into that building and NOT get the pasta-tasting trio in some form or another.  It's just AMAZING!\nOur favorite time to go is for Saturday or Sunday Brunch.  I don't know why - but I think Lidia's Brunch is Pittsburgh's best kept brunch secret.  For $24.99 per person, you get a complimentary Bloody Mary or Mimosa to start, then you are brought your basket of scones, donuts, and breads accompanied by sweet butters.  Then you go up to the Anti-Pasta tables for veggies, egg frittatas, meats, salads, soups - its the ANTI-PASTA table!  Use your imagination (they use theirs!).  Then you order your Brunch Entree - whether that's the Pasta-Tasting trio or Filet & Eggs or Salmon.  After your Entree - you get to go up to their dessert table that always has tiramisu, Italian cookies, mousse, etc.  People give me their brunch suggestions all the time and NO ONE has beaten Lidia's.  Saturdays AND Sundays from 11a-2p.  Just prepare yourself for the food coma after!", "user_id": "RsaEvod4EOBYIdbRBBv0sw", "business_id": "l_Wey2YC6NvVUIH8vTygGg"}
{"text": "I am no vegetarian so I cannot speak for those who are really into that, but this place was awesome. I had been scoping it out for weeks when driving by. Finally I met someone there for lunch. Wifi. Check! Unique and Awesome Milkshakes? Cheeeeck. Tasty awesome foodies. Double Check. I was quite pleased with my experience and I can't wait to go back. Okay so I tried this place twice before writing a review to give them a fair shot. Unfortunately, the second visit wasn't any better.\n\nI will start with the good. Service is pretty good.\n\nThe place smells of smoke. Why? Because you can smoke in the bar and there is an opening from the bar into the restaurant. This has to be a violation of the no smoking in dining areas in Pittsburgh. Gross. \n\nThe floor (carpeted) is so old that it is sticky and worn down. Walking on it with shoes on disgusted me. The walls have wall paper torn off throughout the place. Please, remodel! At least make me feel like the place is clean. If I feel like it is dirty in the dining hall, I can't imagine it's clean in the kitchen.\n\nNow for the food. I am pretty picky about seafood. It needs to be fresh and cooked correctly. Don't get the Salmon or Tuna Steak. Tuna and Salmon should be easy to get right if you just season and cook it properly. Both tasted very fishy to me. Salmon that tastes overly fishy, to me, screams \"this fish is not fresh\". Mashed potatoes are not made from real potatoes. Don't get them unless you are looking to eat boxed potatoes. I get it, you wanna have a mom and pop shop. But to do that you need to have great food.\n\nOverall, I just don't think this place is good, and don't want to go back. D's is just one of those places I love going to. I can't get enough of picking out my own 6 pack of wonderfulness. All amazing beer. The food has never let me down. The service has always been good. This place is just awesome. Whether you want to get loopy with their \"Loopy\" martini or chill out with a classic IPA, this place is a must visit.\n\nI always assumed Olive or Twist was just another chain that wasn't anything special. Toootally my bad. With the exposed bring and dim but not too dim lighting, the atmosphere in this place is chill complete with unique light fixtures and the exposed brick wall. I loved it. I am a lucky North Sider who could easily find myself not stuck parking in the garage, but walking. Park a street over on the street if you are lucky. The parking is the only downfall.\n\nI went here for a date with my boy, followed by drinks with friends, so we really got the whole experience. I thought it'd be dressy since it's located downtown. It was pretty casual dress. Thank goodness because designers don't dress up for work! \n\nTry out the martinis, if you are that type. Even the guys had a grand time trying unique flavors! A must try.\n\nOh yes, and the Seared Tuna Salad is a muuuust. If you aren't feeling the salad, try out the seared tuna app. I was impressed. I walked into this place, having never heard or seen it. I walked out with my heart won over. Staff was friendly. Unbelievably friendly. The chef experiments to make new creations that are like explosions of goodness in your mouth. Yum. The mushroom ravioli was amazing. I DO NOT LIKE MUSHROOMS. But I looooove this dish. Try out the goat cheese with a tiny bit citrus and an apple. Ahh their a h'orderves  are marvelous. Just thinking about it makes me want to go back.\n\nTheir restaurant is beautiful. They have taken the typical Pittsburgh high ceilings and spiced them up with some beautiful hand-blown glass lights. Look up! Oh and the large windows open it up just the perfect amount.  Okay, so I don't technically know if the glass was hand blown, but I like to think so.", "user_id": "njgEC3foXamFUQxsTBeY5A", "business_id": "PzG0XmAmtXFs6Fdnubf41g"}
{"text": "This is my favorite restaurant in the world. I love it substantially more than any Italian restaurant I have frequented in Italy. If there's a special occasion to celebrate, it's done here, no questions asked. Everything on the menu is phenomenal, and the service is phenomenal as well. The restaurant itself is very intimate and cozy and there is valet available, so the fact that it's in a sketchy neighborhood matters not. The bar upstairs is nice, but dining downstairs is something else, as you can watch your food being prepared. Make sure you visit on an empty stomach, as you will be served multiple courses! The vodka pasta you are given is AMAZING. You also get salad and bread with two dips/oil. Entrees are well-sized and you'll probably have the leftovers ever after gorging on all of the mini meals that come before the entree. I do not eat beef... until i go to alla famiglia and order the meatball appetizer. That's saying something, so don't forget to order it. My mum gets some hunk of beef (sorry, I don't even really look at beef/pork options) every time we go and I can hear her making moaning noises as she chews, and then she talks about how to die for it was afterward. I usually get a seafood dish, whatever it may be at the time, and it is always one of the greatest things I have and will ever eat. I want my final meal to be from Alla Famiglia. Please. I don't care if it costs a car payment or two or three. I think 'Burghers are only gooping their pants over Reyna's tacos because they've never had anything other than Taco Bell or its cousin Mad Mex. I'm from the southwestern part of the country and while I certainly appreciate the freshness and \"clarity\" of the food served outside Reyna's, I was not impressed by it. It was nothing that I couldn't and don't already make myself at home. Since Pittsburgh will never be the southwestern states and whatnot, I guess I could go along with saying these are some of the best tacos in the city. First, do not call me sexy and then give me the two most sinewy pieces of toro possible. That pissed me right off. \nSecond, the rolls here are sloppy. Not only did it fall apart very quickly (and was about 4 times too large to eat: a piece of sushi should be able to be comfortably eaten in one bite), but it seems there isn't much thought given to flavors as far as the special rolls go. After my experience with the toro, I don't think I will be giving any sashimi or  *sushi* sushi rolls a try. While the rolls are large, the prices were quite steep, not what i was expecting for someone based in a market that sells seafood. I've eaten plenty of less-than-delicious Italian food, but fortunately more of the delicious kind, whether in the motherland or here at home in the states. While I had high expectations for Lidia's, it gets lumped into the former category. I really hate to say this, but Olive Garden's dishes have more flavor than those we ordered at Lidia's (and I don't even like OG...). I ordered the pasta trio and all three were oh so bland, as was my mother's lasagna bolognese. My S.O. ordered the boar raviolis (I know they weren't called that, but I know nothing of porcines as far as food goes) and thought they were just 'meh' and too salty.  The menu was pretty limited, and it was especially underwhelming considering the prices of the dishes. I wouldn't return here, there are a couple of other restaurants in Pgh that I would rather visit next time i'm in the mood for Italian. Service was good and the atmosphere was pleasant though.", "user_id": "mY080Juh7DTkvLQJSJS1Pw", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g"}
{"text": "The only reason Rock Bottom gets 3 stars is because of the brews. Food was \"eh\", not many vegetarian options and hostesses who will ignore you because they are too busy chatting about who didn't text them back. This place has the potential to be great, but sadly, it falls way too short in almost all areas. sushi was dry and unenjoyable. the place itself is clean and the decor was minimal.  I was not a fan and probably won't be back. What an awesome spot for brunch. Though we don't live too far away the traffic was horrendous and all we could think about was some yummy food to shovel into our mouths. Even though the place was packed we were luckily seated right away and presented with menu eery person wants to see on a Saturday morning. we all ordered what we wanted and didn't have to wait too long! Best part is, everything is made from scratch and you can def tell. \n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed ourselves at a decent price and we will for sure be back. best. beer. selection. hands. down. We waited almost an hour for a table but the bartender was super attentive the whole time and was on point with suggestions. It was def worth the wait too! We ordered a pizza and a few apps which were so good. No complaints here - we will totally be back. I love love love Mad Mex. The one in University City Philly to be exact but when we moved here life was okay because Mad Mex is here too. We've been here a few times because of how close it is to home and each time there is something that just isn't quite right. The most recent time, which is why I'm writing this review, our food took over one hour to come. We repeatedly flagged down our waitress and she kept insisting that she was \"checking on it\" when finally the huz had it and we were about to let the manager have it and then walk out when the manager walked over and apologized for our order never being put in. They took care of the bill but still, left a really poor impression of terrible incompetence. Our waitress never apologized and acted as though nothing happened when she came back to see how everything was. Extremely disappointed with the service. \n\nI'm giving the 3 stars because of my love for Mad Mex and the big azz margaritas but the Greentree location really needs to step it up. I stopped in here for a drink yesterday and to meet some friends at the upstairs lounge. Love it! So spacious, great art work on the walls and the bartenders were extremely nice and attentive. The happy hour drink prices were also pretty good. I didn't get a chance to try any food but I did wander down for a minute and it seemed like everyone was having a good time. I'll def be back! We can here for brunch on Sunday, 5 adults and four month old. I used to be the girl who wouldn't go inside a restaurant if I saw a kid within two blocks of the place but now things have changed. Before I get to my review of the brunch itself I'd like to say how impressed I was with their accommodations for babies! The changing station in the bathroom had wipes, a small sitting area and it was almost private. Fabulous. But the best part was they gave us a cradle-type thing in which our baby slept like the angel he is most certainly not. If he wasn't sleeping in it, he was just laying there playing and we could have brunch with our adult friends without having to entertain or keep an eye on our little love. Thanks Lidia's - you won me over with those two things alone.\n\nThe brunch itself was fantastic. The bread with three sweet, butter spreads was my favorite. My mimosa was actually a mimosa and not just orange juice with a splash of champagne. The buffet was 90%vegetarian and never looked empty because the staff was always bringing out new dishes. For my entree I had the manicotti but also tasted the pasta trio from my friend. Yumm! And the dessert spread? Yeah I was in heaven. \n\nOverall, we had an amazing time and will def be back.", "user_id": "_e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg", "business_id": "McikHxxEqZ2X0joaRNKlaw"}
{"text": "The Dor-Stop is a great small breakfast restaurant.  Once you enter the doors of pancake heaven you are greeted with friendly staff and the delicious smells of pancakes and meat on the griddle and other various breakfast aromas.  We came Sunday for breakfast and, boy does this place fill up!  \n\nThe Dor-Stop has gained fame from Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, but that's not what I care about! I just want the food!  So, that's what I did, I ordered the food after ordering my coffee.  Their menu has all of the classics including their signature pancakes, omelets, french toast and eggs cooked to suit.\n\nMy coffee cup and water were kept full and while sipping on my caffeinated beverage, my meal came.  The Dor-Stop produced my order of two eggs over medium, and two large banana, chocolate chip pancakes.  I was speechless once I took a bite of that cakey, breakfast goodness (the pancakes not the eggs!).  The pancakes are really delicious. They have the perfect texture, the perfect taste, the perfect look, the perfect smell... need I go on?  The eggs were good too, I don't want to leave them out, but what egg is going to win again the battle of pancakes v eggs?\n\nBreakfast Breakdown,\n\nThe Food: Delicious!\nThe Value: I believe my two egg combo was $7.99. Breakfast for four with coffee was close to $40. That's not too bad.\nThe Experience:  It's a small restaurant full of happy people! I happened to glance at the table next to us  and saw the breakfast burrito.  It's massive!\nWould I return?: Why, yes. I wish I lived closer so I could eat them every Sunday.\n5 stars?: I've been to a restaurant that claimed to have the best pancakes in the world.  They were wrong. The Dor-Stop has the best pancakes and for not claiming to have the best, they get 5 stars, because these pancakes were heaven sent!\n\nBonus game!: How many times were pancakes and breakfast mentioned in this review? Points to the winner! Lidias is a classy restaurant in the strip district. There's valet parking for $6 if you so wish to do so.  You step inside and see that its not a super large restaurant,  but it is large enough and has a cozy feel to it.  The light fixtures are brightly colored glass and are beautiful.  Take a look at the bar on the back wall, because it is very striking.  You dont have to dress up, but it doesnt hurt to look a little bit because you dont want a chandelier to upstage you!\n\nThe menu is a two pager and everything looked very good.  My group all ordered the pasta trio.  The trio included a spaghetti type with roasted cauliflower and tomatoes, penne with ragu and mushroom ravioli. Each pasta was delicious and it was impossible to choose a favorite.  The servings are unlimited so you dont have to miss any pasta for very long before more is brought to you.  Each pasta satisfied a different food craving (light, hearty and rich) and this is what made it difficult to choose a favorite.  Dessert was also very good and I had split the chocolate cake with my uncle. Just in case you're wondering,  the chocolate cake has no shredded coconut so eat away! The description mentions coconut several times and ordinarily I'm scared that it will have shredded coconut,  but this was safe.  \n\nLidias was a great experience and I'm glad I went.  I think its worthy of 5 stars because the service, food and atmosphere was wonderful.  Tutti a tavola a mangiare!", "user_id": "kB4FK7vCRML_v9dabD2PiQ", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw"}
{"text": "This is great, simple, traditional italian american food. The salads are good. The pizza is really great (I stopped ordering from anywhere else).  The veal cannelloni is awesome too. Very tasty food and drinks! Its a little pricey, but worth it if you want something better than a typical chain. We stopped by for the first time on a cold Friday night around 9:30. We made sure to have reservations, as the place is pretty small. It's BYOB and we didn't bring our own wine because we weren't in a drinking mood, but once we sat down we realized this was the kind of place where you needed a bottle of wine. The decor is like an slightly charming mess of old furniture, clean table clothes, and scarves draped over the windows of the converted garage. We sat right by the door and right under the old dresser that the owners stand at. \n\nThe food was good. We ordered the tomato garlic bisque, which was delicious. The stuffed peppers with crab and goat cheese were tasty, but the plate was super hot and the peppers were cold, so that was a bit off. For main courses we ordered the salmon and the lobster ravioli. The salmon was great. It w cooked well and had a dill cream sauce on it. It was supposed to be served with risotto, but instead came with a dried cake of old creamy looking rice. I ignored that and ate the steamed and grilled veggies they used to garnish the plate. The lobster ravioli was amazing, but instead of coming in it's own sauce, they simply poured on the tomato garlic bisque that we had already ordered as a first course. After reading mixed reviews about this place, I was pleasantly surprised, \n\nThis place was a hot mess with slightly cold food, but I really liked it. I really liked this food. I'm not Indian, but my boyfriend is. He liked it too! \n\nWe stopped in on a Saturday afternoon. We ordered from the menu instead of the buffet. We ordered the chili chicken, chicken 65, lamb biryani, Lamb vindaloo, and tadka dal. It was delicious. The chicken 65 wasn't spicy or flavorful enough, but everything else was incredible. We spiced everything at. 7/10. It had a bite, but wasn't too hot. \n\nErythema was freshly made. There were only two other families in the restaurant when we were there, both Indian/Pakistani? \n\nService was slow and grumpy. But it was totally worth it. It's hard to find good Indian food in Pittsburgh. Udipi is ok for pure veg... Corriander is greasy... India gardens dishes all taste the same... \n\nI would return. \n\nPortions were small, but I like that because then you can order more things to taste! Although, prices were relatively high. Every entree was about $12 and were ordered 4. It was worth it regardless. Absolutely delish taco stand out front... Fish, lamb, chicken, beef, carnitas! They serve them fresh off the grill with all the fixin's! They have serval fresh salsa and hot sauces too! \n\nI love the food inside too! Great groceries! I went here on a crowded saturday night with a large party (8 people at our table.) I ordered the spicy calamari. It was not spicy. It was overcooked, like rubber, and served on plain white beans. Yuck. I won't go back. My boyfriend had the seafood dish. Most of his seafood was also overcooked and tasteless. We visited for brunch last Sunday. It was amazing. It is $28 a person and includes a prefix menu. You get a morning cocktail, antipasto buffet, choice of entree (endless fresh made pasta trio is an option) and a dessert buffet. \n\nThe serve was impeccable. The sangria and Bloody Mary were delicious. The pasta trio was incredible. The salads at the buffet were so thoughtful and tasty. Would go again! I want to make this place a tradition. \n\nGreat management! Excellent food!", "user_id": "L6y73vaWaSvqYUKq6Rsr2w", "business_id": "Pu5uzlZ05pqVlx6LcZbfgw"}
{"text": "I love me some Mad Mex but, I have to say that I have never had anything but the grilled fish tacos.  They are so good that I never felt the need to get anything  else when I order.  Why mess up a good thing.  This specific location is very nice and out of the way but I have to say that the fish tacos at the location in Monroeville, PA are much better than here.  Not sure if it was just an off day because I have eaten here before, but at Monroeville they are VERY consistent on delivering a darn good grilled fish (mahi-mahi) taco.  Today's dish was still very, very good but the fish was slightly dry.  I'm being picky here but that is only because I have eaten at least 50 or so grilled fish tacos from Mad Mex.  Now, in giving my review, know this .... I still got an order to bring home.  YES, I did.  For some reason (like lasagna) they are better the next day.  I will be eating them for breakfast. Last time I was here was about 3 years ago. I have been avoiding this place since the recent reviews have been very mixed.  Today I was in the mood for BulGogi and my friend wanted sushi.  So at Sushi Kim we arrived.  I have never been here for dinner, only lunch and there is always enough tables and space.  (Perhaps this is the best time to go) We both ordered from their lunch special menu; Sushi sampler & spicy pork BulGoGi & also an app of shrimp dumplings.  Was not a fan of the dumplings but our pork was delicious, tender and spicy and the sushi was a nice mix and fresh.  My friend ordered the green tea ice cream and my sample of it was quite tasty.  We each had a glass of wine and with tip got out of there at around $50.00.  Not bad.  \nTheir menu is extensive and it may be hit or miss here depending on what you order.  I have always had a hit with their BulGoGi, Korean Pancake, Hot Pots and   sushi.  Their service was attentive, but again, we were there for a late lunch and the place was not packed.  All in all, the food was very tasty, service was good and price was respectable. I have only eaten here for the Prix Fix Menu for weekend brunch.  You will need a reservation and this menu is only served from 11am to 2pm.  I have been here 4x for this brunch menu and it is ALWAYS AMAZING.  For the reasonable price you will get a chosen alcoholic drink, full antipasto bar for you appetizer (which is delightful) you will get a choice of a dozen entrees including vegetarian, then an tasty desert bar with many choices of Italian cookies, pastries, and coffee/espresso.  Take your time here so you can eat slowly and appreciate all the amazing eats this place has to offer.  Your brunch will take at least 1.5 hrs and the staff.... well they DO NOT rush you and are very attentive and friendly.  I recommend getting here around noon and just taking your time to truly experience this culinary tour.  Lidia's will surely become your standard to which all other Italian restaurants are measured.  OH .. If your looking for Chicken or veal parmigiana, pizza, or any variation of Chef Boy Ardee well... go elsewhere, Lidia's is an Italian adventure and you WILL BE BACK !! Another great (WEEKEND) brunch at Lidia's. $28.00 Prix fixe.  Today I had the Yellow Fin Tuna special.  Seared Yellow Fin with Broccoli Rabe and mango salsa verde.  I did not expect the portion to be so big.  I actually had to get it wrapped to take home.  Their Antipasto table is always delicious with seasonal additions.  Today, among the regular fare, (like their marinated/seasoned olives) there were mussels, a broccoli salad and caramelized onions atop crunchy bread.  All Yummy !! \nMy Yellow tail special was cooked perfectly and delicious; I was really surprised at the large piece of tuna.  (posted pic) I did have reservations (recommended) so I was seated immediately and the service here is always stellar.  For $28.00 you can not get a better meal (and a drink)  You will be full by the time you leave, and the food is so creative and scrumptious.  The staff never rushes you out !!  Take your time, eat and eat more and enjoy !!  Just some FYI.  The $28. brunch is only on Sat & Sun. There is LOT parking right across the street, on Smallman St., with tons of spaces.  Today it was $6.00 for all day parking; I have never seen it above $10.00.   Worth it because it is right at Lidia's front door and if you planning on visiting the Strip Shops afterwards, it is an all day price.  Much better than looking for street parking and walking for blocks.  \nYelp asks if this place is good for kids ??  This is kind of hard to answer.  It is a casual place but \"upscale\" casual if that makes sense.  Children are never an issue for me if they are well behaved and entertained.  Speaking only of their \"brunch\" I would say OK for kids but the cuisine is not really geared towards a child.  If you bring a child under the age of 12 well, I think you may have to feed them from the dessert bar.  I just don't think that they would find the antipasto table or creative menu options appealing.  When I was 12, I did not even know what Antipasto meant.

{"text": "I believe it was Aristotle who once said, \"Holy craaaaaaaaaaaaap!\" Based on the dining experience I had last night, I can only assume that he'd just eaten at Casbah when he said that.\n\nPittsburgh is a city that has no shortage of *amazing* restaurants and among those, Casbah is one of the best.\n\nI went with my two kids (foodies at heart and who are both up for anything, always--no chicken nuggets for these two) and our experience, from the moment we crossed the threshold til we floated out after we were finished, was damned close to perfection. \n\nFirst off, THE WINE LIST. Sweet niblets. I had a glass of Michel-Schlumberger Pinot Noir that was so good that my eyes actually crossed. CRAZY good. And the rest of the selection was just as impressive. \n\nWe were served a basket of hot-from-the-oven bread with sea-salted butter and this otherworldly strained Greek yogurt stuff with lemon that was so yummy I seriously considered licking the plate. Seemed reasonable at the time. \n\nAppetizers were flatbread with hummus, baba ghanouj, and red pepper muhummara (sublime) and veal/pork meatballs with crispy Brussels sprouts that earned a resounding \"OMG!\" from the young uns.\n\nThe girl child ate--and swooned over--short rib ravioli, the boy devoured (and waxed rhapsodic over) his orecchiette with Elysian Farms chicken, and I lost myself in (and have pledged my troth to) the best cioppino I've ever eaten (San Francisco, eat your heart out).\n\nBut wait! There's more!\n\nDessert. Holy yum balls. Kid #1 had raspberry-chocolate bread pudding with cr\u00eame Anglaise, Kid #2 had the chocolate cheeesecake bombe. Both kids were over the moon and doing things like pledging to clean their rooms every day (that must've been SOME dessert). \n\nOn top of all this, the service was AH-mazing. Every person who came to the table was funny and smiling and bending over backward to make the meal all it should have been. And it was.\n\nI've eaten at a great many of this city's best restaurants and this was one of the best experiences I've had here. Holy cannoli. No, really. HOLY CANNOLI.\n\nBut I'll get to dessert in a sec.\n\nMy kids and I visited Lidia's the night before Easter and were blown away by everything from the atmosphere to the service to the food.\n\nOur server, Becky, was hilarious and bent over backward to meet our every need. BIG plus.\n\nWe started with drinks--the kids with Lidia's Italian sodas (vanilla cream and blackberry sage) and I with an orange Manhattan. I'd substitute another bourbon for Maker's next time, but it was reallllly good. \n\nWhile we waited for the appetizer course, we were offered a selection of fresh-baked breads (grissini with grana padano, focaccia, and a sturdy Tuscan bread), served with kalamata olive-cannellini bean and basil pesto spreads. SO good. \n\nOur first course was Burrata with broccoli rabe, olive oil, and grilled bread. The Flavors were bright, fresh, and fabulous.\n\nMy daughter got the pasta trio (a solid choice in my estimation), which included penne with sausage and caramelized onions, ravioli with thyme-butter sauce, and fettuccine with basil pesto. YUM.\n\nMy son went with house garganelli pasta, lemon garlic cream, crispy fried shrimps, chives, toasted pine nuts. Holy CATS, it was good.\n\nI had gnocchi with braised duck ragu. It was to DIE for.\n\nDessert featured tiramisu, Nutella budino with candied hazelnuts, and Zuppa Inglese which was a crazy good melange of amaretto-soaked sponge cake, pastry cream and pistachio cream with raspberry sorbetto, lemon custard sauce, fresh raspberries and candied almonds. There is a God, clearly.\n\nWe had a GREAT time. Lots of jokes and smiles from the wait staff, a relaxed atmosphere, and FANTASTIC food. Just right.

{"text": "I rate this 5 stars for martinis and lounge, but it's only a 4 for me because the food was average.  I went here with a group of friends for a birthday, The fiance and I had dinner downstairs first and then went upstairs to the lounge.  If you are with a group, it's a pretty fun and chill place and they were playing good danceable music, which my friends and I liked.  It didn't seem that packed for a saturday, so it was easy to get a drink.  I think there's also servers walking around the lounge to take orders, so another plus.\n\nThe dining area was pretty small, but we made a reservation just about 2 hours prior to arriving, and we didn't have to wait. My fiance and I shared the calamari, which was really delicious!  Usually, the calamari we get is seasoned with just salt & pepper with maybe some breading at times and chilli and scallions, but this one was a different taste and it was tasty!  It seemed a little asian inspired kind of like sweet with some crumble and salty with soy.  I had the seared ahi tuna salad.  I liked the taste, but it isn't the best ahi to me.  Fish didn't taste that fresh to me.  My fiance had the braised short rib with the mashed potatoes and he said it was only 3 stars for him. He got his friend a turkey wrap and he said it was average. \n\nThe real highlight for us were the martinis!  I am not one for martinis but after tasting sweet/bakery inspired martinis, I am feening for it. LOL.  I had the cake batter martini and the chocolate covered pretzel.  Sooo good! They got really creative here with the martinis and the presentation.  Definitely 5 stars for the martini bar :)  Will go back to taste the rest! My hubby bought a groupon for this place, so we tried it tonight.  We were going to go with a group of friends, but they only allow 1 groupon per table. \n\nValet was $7 and they park your car right in front which is convenient.  Walking in, they had 2 hostesses who were very pleasant.  The decor is modern.  Our server was really nice and attentive.  I think his name is Chando?  I appreciate it too when the server offers to box leftovers instead of customers having to ask for boxes.  I guess I feel like I'm not imposing when they offer to do it. \n\nAs we were seated, he filled our water glasses and talked to us about the groupon, which included a bottle of wine from the $32 list (which is possibly their cheapest wine selection).  The selection here is pretty extensive.  I really enjoyed the bread basket with the garbanzo and cannelini bean hummus.  I think that's what they were.  My husband got the soup of the day which he said was just ok.  Nothing special.  My caesar salad was also the norm but there was so much of it, which was a waste.  \n\nI like the pasta tasting trio, which our server said varies daily depending on the chef's selection.  We had the paparrdele w/ sausage and cabbage, gemelli with spinach and ricotta and ramp, pea, asparagus ravioli.  All tasted pretty good.  My fave among the three waa the pappardele and my hubby liked the ravioli.  I did notice our server called the gemelli a fusilli but they do look pretty similar, and I didn't really mind bc either way, the dish would prob taste the same.  The servers came around with the food efficiently and I felt like I was at an all you can eat brazilian steakhouse only with the chip always on green side. No complains though because we were able to take our food to go.\n\nWe also ended up taking the tiramisu to go and actually haven't tasted it yet.  It looked good!  Price wise, if we didn't have a groupon, I think the bill would've been $104 plus two tiramisus, so the groupon was prob a 50% off deal.  Overall, I would recommend the food we had and the service.", "user_id": "2t1-DyiofeAg2s8yz9L9oQ", "business_id": "OxIeMVcop5oxBUWANi-1Rw"}
{"text": "I can't believe this place got a bad rating!!! Sure, it's not a 5-star restaurant, but you can't beat the price or the food!!!\nWhy would you order french fries at a Greek restaurant? I want everyone to disregard the previous bad rating about this place. \nI live about a block away from Salonika's, and I absolutely love it. The first time I went in, I noticed that it was rockin while every restaurant nearby was empty. Very good sign, trust me!!\nSure, there are no waiters. You order at the front counter and linger around until your food is ready, but I've never had to wait more than a few minutes. \nThe food is absolutely amazing!!! And cheap!!! My boyfriend loves the chicken with pasta, which is exactly what it says it is: pasta with chunks of chicken. It is lightly seasoned, but no heavy sauces. And it's amazingly filling. \nI always get the Greek salad or the pastitsio. The greek salad comes loaded with onions, feta, olives, and jalapeno peppers that are marinated in some kind of garlic marinade. And there is always enough dressing!!! Homemade dressing at that. \nThe pastitsio is definitely an acquired taste. It's like a greek lasagne, but without cheese. It consists of a large layer of very spiced beef, then layers of noodles and a cream sauce. \nI bring a lot of friends to Salonika's when they trek downtown to hang-out with me, and EVERY SINGLE PERSON I have introduced to this place absolutely LOVES IT!!! I usually make them get a gyro, and I can't tell you how many of my friends will go back up for another one because they are so good. The gyro meat is fresh, in fact they carve it right there. \nThere is also a bar in the back of the restaurant. I kind of wish it wasn't there because it attracts some \"unsavories\" and takes away from the atmosphere in the restaurant. But you can't win them all.\nKeep in mind that this is a cash-only establishment, so hit the ATM on the way. \nYou will not be disappointed with this place. This place is really a gem!!! It was my Anniversary tonight, a Tuesday. I was so excited to get All You Can Eat Crab  Legs!!! My favorite food of all time!!! But when we arrived at 8:20pm, the very unfriendly waitress said that their kitchen was closed!!!!! BOOOOOOOOOO!!!! Their website, as well as Yelp, states that they are open until 10pm!!! We would've been long gone by then! Very disappointing. Well, we ended up driving a lot farther than we intended, but had a wonderful dinner at Joe's Crab Shack in Station Square. I got my LEGS!!!! And they had $2 Hurricanes to boot!!! Ended up eating a better meal, with cheaper drinks, and we ended up tipping our waiter 30% because he was awesome!!!! Should've just gone there in the first place! I will know better from now on!!! Just had a wonderful dinner here! My boyfriend and I have been together for just over 4 years and he has talked about this place many times! We have never been!!! When I saw the Groupon, I just had to get it. It was a nice surprise for him, especially on a Tuesday!\nLoved the bread and hummus-esque dippers, caesar salad, 3 pastas, and awesome tiramisu! The waiter was great! So wish I had remembered his name. He let us share one tiramisu there, and bagged the other up for later. He also rinsed and let me keep the sweet GLASS cork from bottle of red wine I selected. (It was the Nero d'Avola, btw). Not a bad wine, tasted better once we were actually eating. The second waiter? was great as well! \nWill definitely return!

{"text": "I have been eating their sauerbraten since I was a little girl.  I love this place.  I love the old-fashioned decor, the room setup makes you feel as if you're in an old house, and there is a piano that plays itself by the bar if you feed it a quarter.\n\nif you're a first time visitor, i reccomend their wonderful sampler platter that allows you to choose 3 (i think) entrees and some sides.\n\nsuperyum! This is what a diner should be.  Yummy, fresh(ish) food with staple american bites like burgers and meatloaf sandwiches.  Cramped, with experienced servers that leave the check on the table with the food.\n\nMy soup was the meal's highlight- obviously made from scratch in the kitchen.  Reuben burger- pretty good.  Side of fries- okay.  came from the freezer, but were served hot.\n\nI would dine again.  if i am ever awake during their hours of operation. My scallops were luke-warm yet overcooked.  The carrots on my salad looked like they had been sitting in the bottom of a fridge for weeks. \n\nThe first time I dined here, I was unimpressed with their lobster roll (which is simply a hollowed-out white roll filled with lobster.  bread and seafood, that's IT).  Today, I was unimpressed with everything.\n\nExcept the woman two tables over who laughed like cigar-smoking circus clown and looked like Patrick Swayze in drag.  That was pretty awesome. This is the first and only korean bbq i have ever visited.  that said, i can't wait to bring my whole family here at the end of the month for my birthday!  I had so much fun filling my plate with marinated treats and cooking them on my table!  it was a really amazing and unique  dining experience.\n\nif this place sucks compared to the average korean bbq, I can't wait to try an outstanding one! But for now, in Pittsburgh, I don't know of anywhere else like it.  and I'm in love. The entire balcony of old ladies paused to gawk at my companion with green hair as we were seated in the main dining room for sunday brunch.  He looked at me like I was crazy when I opted to take the bloody mary instead of continue to nurse my  2-day hangover.\n\nOur waitress was robotic and efficient.  After ordering the pasta sampler as my entree, I loaded a small plate of munchies at the antipasti table.  My favorite?  The ceasar salad.  Big fat lettuce leaves coated with fresh dressing and imported, shredded cheese.  A staple food really well done.\n\nThen as my buddy's meal came, a bare plate was set in front of me, and 30 seconds later a nice man approached my table and scooped pasta directly out of a skillet onto my plate.  It happened twice more, in quick succession.  I was left with an arrabiata fetticuine noodle (light and obviously made fresh in the kitch), a handful of asparagus-pea ravioli in a buttery sauce, and a heavy orchettie with sausage.  All three were exceptionally yummy, though when I was finished with the meal, there was a decent amount of sausage pasta left on my plate.\n\nI would definitely eat here again, but for the price, not on a regular basis. I adore Ephesus.  Super under-rated.  It's a pizza place with a Turkish background so in addition to making some pretty decent pizza, they serve traditional turkish/middle- eastern fare like kefta, falafel, baba, hummus- and its really good!\n\nTheir Adana Koeffte platter is to die for.  And I just tried a new item yesterday called a \"pide\" (pe-day)- its a \"turkish pizza\" (shaped kinda like a football with a thinner, different \"crust\") topped with ground spiced meat, diced tomato, spinach, cheeses- I lost my mind, it was amazing.  I am going back later this week to get another.  maybe two!\n\nOh, and they deliver!  to half the city!

{"text": "It was either Mother Theresa or the Baha Men who said \"Who let the dogs out?\" and I must say, I was glad someone let my bacon cheddar dog out of the kitchen and into my stomach.  Dee-licious!\n\nStopped in here before seeing a movie at the Regent Square Theater for some beers, dogs and chili cheese fries.  I had two IPAs that were good and reasonably priced.  I couldn't finish the fries so I took them with me to the movie theater and the lady didn't mind that I brought them in.  I finished them fairly quickly once the movie started (I was seeing the Swedish version of \"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" so this was a while ago.)\n\nAlso, since I was just visiting town, I didn't have a car and I rode the bus there all the way by myself!\n\nSo the point is, you can eat here and get a great dog and good beer, and you can also take the bus here and then see a movie. Dieters and supermodels stay away...there is nothing for you here.\n\nGreat big honking sandwiches.  You've seen them on TV and maybe they seem like a gimmick, but they really work.  Love the corned beef especially.  This location is not as \"real\" as the one down in the Strip District, but it's pretty cool.\n\nThere's a long line to order but it moves fairly fast.  Getting your food is a different story, so don't come here in a rush.  However, do come here.  If it's too crowded in the restaurant (or at their outdoor tables), then grab a table in the Market Square across the street and ingest these delicious gutbombs.   They also have a great beer selection so you can finish a pint or two while you're waiting for your grub. 90 minutes for two cold pizzas.....sorry at this point even a two star review is generous.\n\nWhile in town with friends, we wanted an easy meal after running the half marathon earlier in the day.  Consulting Yelp, I saw that this place had good reviews, they delivered and since we were less than a mile from them, we figured we'd have the food fairly fast (there were two hungry toddlers and five hungry adults, and we needed food, stat!)\n\nUpon calling, we first asked if they delivered to hotels just to be sure.  If they didn't, that would be fine we'd call someplace else.  So we ordered our two pizzas and gave them the name and address of the hotel. It is a newish hotel, so I told my buddy to tell them \"It's right by the Consol Energy Center, where the Penguins play\".  I figured that even if they didn't know the hotel or the address, most people in Pittsburgh would know where the Penguins play.  We were concerned when we had to say the name of the hotel four times and as it turned out, we were right to be concerned.\n\nAfter an hour with no pizzas, we call and they guy says \"Oh, the delivery guy is on your street right now.  Should be 2 minutes\".  20 minutes later the delivery guy calls and says he's on his way.  We ask if he knows where he's going and he says yes.  10 minutes later he calls again and asks where we are.  When we finally got the pizza, it was not hot.  The cheese had congealed everywhere and it looked like it had been cut by a toddler.  There were so big slices, some little slices...just not the usual uniform slices.\n\nI felt bad for the guy because he said his GPS had been stolen that morning, but we tried everything to make sure that the place new we were at the hotel right beside the arena and it still failed.  \n\nBetter luck next time.", "user_id": "zvJCcrpm2yOZrxKffwGQLA", "business_id": "2X5G4Ujq0s4Wfn4TC7gX0g"}
{"text": "It's just like being back in some small town just outside of Munich... If I'd ever actually been to some small town just outside of Munich! It's not the touristy disaster that is Hofbrauhaus, nor do they serve beer in hefty pints like Penn Brew. Rather they just serve really good authentic German food, with a small selection of imported German beer. Wunderbar! Hot, crispy squares of pizza with mounds of cold cheese on top.  Kind of weird when you first try it, but dammit, it does grow in you. It's OK to come here for beer and snacks, but avoid anything more complicated than a serving of mussels or the Lobster Roll. \n\nThe mussels are fresh and they really do give you a whole lot, but there's not too much broth (The best part of ordering mussels is usually sopping up the broth with bread). The lobster roll has plenty of lobster, it's fresh and tasty, but the roll itself is a bit greasy. It didn't bother me that much, but some people seem to be put off by it. \n\n My wife ordered the \"stuffed shrimp platter,\" which I put in quotes because the \"platter\" consists of 5 medium/small overcooked rubbery shrimp and some unseasoned overcooked veggies. They charge like $23 for this, which is a complete ripoff. \n\nThe service is spotty, and sometimes people feel the need to smoke standing right next to you if you are seated outside, which is really enjoyable (bleh). This place is a disaster. First, the decor in reminiscent of some sort of condemned fun-house.  The lighting is dark and dank, kind of like a dungeon or a serial killer's basement. The floors and booths all kind of tilt downward to the east, just ever so perceptibly, so you're not really sure if it's real or if you're just imagining it. Maybe the whole place is built on top of an old graveyard full of Italian Grandmas that roll over every time someone sits down for dinner there. The service is really spotty too. The receptionists seem a bit befuddled. The servers seem miserable and exhausted, like they work about 48 hour straight shifts. Or they're just high. Not that I blame them. If I worked there, I'd probably want to get high before I came in to work too. \n\nPros: Never a dull moment. Between the kids running rampant around the place, and the 500+ pound diners trying their damnedest to eat the place out of business, there's no shortage of entertainment to be had. \n\nCons: Everything else. \n\nThe whole experience can be both amusing and depressing at the same time. It's a really  sad Americanized fast-food version of Italian food that you can duplicate at home for about 4 bucks by boiling some water and heating up a jar of sauce. \n\nThis is where the management teams from Olive Garden and Buca de Beppo should visit just to see what would happen if they stopped caring. I REALLY wanted to like this place, because  everything she makes on her show looks like how The Italian Grandma I Never Had would have made it. But it's really just above average, and borderline criminally overpriced. The place really is beautiful, and the service is great, but there's only so much you should legally be able to charge for a pasta dish, especially when you're just 10 minutes away from Bloomfield. I got a sub from Bella Notte just down the street from Peppi's and I will never do that again! Bella Notte puts about one slice of each kind of meat and a bare minimum of toppings on a lot of bread, while Peppi's absolutely stuffs their subs with meat and toppings. The best is the Franco, which is an Italian sub. It really hits the spot and is plenty big enough for two hungry adults to share. Bella Notte is for pizza. Peppi's is for subs.", "user_id": "z5ap03HKlU_9sWjIjFN0Eg", "business_id": "IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ"}
{"text": "I went here at 3 PM between the lunch rush and the dinner rush, and the restaurant was maybe 20% full. I ordered the Chili Mac Supreme to go. I thought I would be in and out within 5-10 minutes. Keep in mind that this restaurant even has a drive-thru; the expectation is quick service.\n\nLong story short, my food never came... the waitress told me (after I had been sitting there waiting for thirty minutes) that the kitchen hadn't even started on my order yet, so I told her to cancel it and walked out. Now I see that others on Yelp have warned about the slow service at this location. Wish I had looked it up earlier. Excellent wings and sandwiches, generally good food otherwise, and fair prices-- nice casual place. The service can be a little slow due to how popular the place gets at peak times. I went here around 12:30 AM on January 1, 2011, after New Years' Eve. They had a breakfast buffet laid out.\n\nI'd barely gone to any Eat 'n Parks this past year because my local one (in Edgewood) is horrible, so I was pleasantly surprised that there was nothing wrong here. We were seated quickly, the waiter handled the beverage orders quickly, and the buffet was fine. No problems at all, except when the place got completely packed around 1 AM and we had a bit of trouble tracking down the waiter to get our check... That wasn't a big deal, though.\n\nI can't justify giving more than 3 stars due to the fact that Eat 'n Park isn't exactly fine dining, but we got filling food for minimal hassle, so it was a good experience overall. Passable, cheap Chinese food. I like the Kung Pao chicken, but they definitely put in too many carrots. I went here twice using a Groupon.\n\nBoth times, the restaurant was dead- as in, fewer than five tables occupied. Because of that, the service was always quick.\n\nFood was consistently good, but nothing mind-blowing.\n\nIf your pockets are deep enough not to mind the prices, this is a solid choice of restaurant for a special occasion, but as another reviewer mentioned, there is a certain \"cheesyness\" to the place... like it's trying just a little bit too hard to seem like a legitimate high-class restaurant and bar. I think maybe that sensation was heightened by the fact that the restaurant was totally dead, as I mentioned... Almost like people were shunning the place. (In reality, I guess it was just off-peak days and hours.) I've lived in Allegheny County my whole life, but only went to the Original Oyster House for the first time today. I'd heard they were reputed to have the best fish sandwich in the city, so that's what I was looking for. \n\n(By the way, as a side-note to the people, on Yelp and elsewhere, who whine about how a restaurant with the word \"Oyster\" in its name should focus on gourmet oysters and not fish sandwiches: Jesus, grow up. I don't go to Red Robin because I'm in the mood for some robin carpaccio, and I don't go to the Silk Elephant because I'm in the mood for some broiled pachyderms. A name is just a name. This is a very old establishment, and if you didn't do your homework going in to know what's good to order nowadays, then the fault is wholly yours, and I have zero sympathy. To quote a wise Russian: CRY SOME MORE.)\n\nAnyway, back to the sandwich:\n\nI got a platter with fries, slaw, and the sandwich. Sounds very pedestrian, sure, but it was far from ordinary. The slaw was very substantial and was dressed well without being overwhelming. The fries were extremely fresh, had a lot of substance to them, and were satisfyingly crispy. The fish sandwich itself- heck, I can hardly write about it, because I couldn't help but to inhale it. It was the best fish sandwich I can recall ever having eaten, and I could hardly stop myself from wolfing it down, bite after intoxicating bite. It's something you really just need to experience for yourself.\n\nI ate at the bar, and your usual condiments (ketchup, tartar sauce, salt, pepper, etc) were easily at hand. I used a moderate dollop of tartar sauce on my sandwich, which was great, but I'm sure the sandwich would have stood up fine without it, too. A lot of places' fish sandwiches are extremely bland and dry, making the tartar sauce necessary just to swallow it down, but the OOH's sandwich needs no such crutch. The tartar sauce is able to do what it's really meant to do: complement an already-excellent fish dish\n\nSo, what else can I say? I feel like my life as a Pittsburgher is enriched just knowing that this place exists, and I can't believe I've been missing out as long as I have been. I'm a graduate student at Pitt, and I can guarantee that whenever I have a solid hour free for lunch, I'll hop a bus downtown to get another fish sandwich platter. After today, I can't imagine a better Pittsburgh lunch- not even Primanti's.", "user_id": "nCi-BpCo_4iNFPb4QWUL6w", "business_id": "6ilJq_05xRgek_8qUp36-g"}
