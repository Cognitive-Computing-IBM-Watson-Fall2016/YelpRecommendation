{"text": "Such a pleasure to dine, on my birthday, at a restaurant with such good food and cocktails right in Shadyside. We planned in advance to come here after I received Big Burrito's free-entree birthday voucher** and after  coming here to sample dessert and drinks. The food--short rib ravioli, lamb and polenta, pumpkin cake with ice cream and toffee--was insanely rich and tasty and decadent, perfect for a celebratory meal. Our server made some clutch drink recommendations too. My favorite: the local martini, all made with locally-sourced ingredients and ridiculously good chevre-stuffed olives. Almost like a cocktail and small plate in one.\n\nAfter reading everyone else's reviews, I hope to come back here next for brunch.\n\n**to take Big Burrito up on this offer, join their mailing list decently before your birthday, and a voucher will come in the mail! It was a blissful discovery for a pair of graduate students. Even though they were out of the first beers we asked for (the Dogfish Punkin) this place hit the spot for a junk food craving. Vegetarians: the veggie dog is awesome, not rubbery or pale but nearly mistakable for an actual hot dog. I ordered one with kraut and mustard, and my boyfriend braved the three-cheese dog, which was hard to pick up but looked tasty. Their fries were good, and were generously portioned (definitely shareable) for a $1.50 small. Next time, we'll delve more into their beer selection. I need to return to Soba for entrees; this review is for pretty much everything else on the menu--small plates, drinks, and dessert. Three of us went through four small plates slowly, and with the apt guidance of our patient and chipper waiter. It was nice not to be rushed, even though we intended to graze through the meal. The tuna tartare was conventional, but tasty, and the lobster maki's lobster was hard to taste or even find. However, the short rib buns--wow. Short ribs are everywhere lately--thanks, Top Chef--but I'd eat these every day, as their richness and warmth was balanced brightly by pickled cucumber and cilantro. We washed these plates down with cocktails: I'd highly recommend mine, which had amaretto, sake, and coconut milk and tasted like a cool, smooth cookie. We then split two desserts with dessert wine and sherry to match. The chocolate maki had us licking our fingers.\n\nI'm not totally sold on the originality of the menu, but it sure tasted good. Next up: Casbah! Anyone who says that there's no good sushi in Pittsburgh (and I've heard you say it, folks, right here on Yelp!) hasn't been to Umi yet. I'd been mostly satisfied, sushi-wise, by quality if standard places like Little Tokyo in the South Side and Chaya in Squirrel Hill before I went to Umi with my roommate last Saturday. \n\nThe first major difference between Umi and the places mentioned above: price. Umi, a Big Burrito joint, is much more expensive than other sushi places in town. That said, if you have the dough, go for the $75/person omakase. We enjoyed eight courses (7 dinner + 1 dessert course), each one subtle and well-seasoned and incredibly fresh. (Now we're broke, but that's my cross to bear.) The black cod and the nigiri course were stand-out favorites. The prices on the a-la-carte sushi, in contrast, looked only slightly more costly than others in town.\n\nThe second difference: innovation. Sometimes, I just want straight-up, unadorned sushi, and when I do, I doubt I'll come back to Umi. However, if I'm looking for a fine dining experience, one where the ingredients are creative and innovative, I'll definitely return here. One of the best meals I've had in PGH yet!\n\nA final caveat: don't forget to make a reservation. The restaurant was packed when we were there, and due to its small size, I doubt they can squeeze too many walk-ins in on a busy night.", "user_id": "CSnoMljca4d2gcXsFlUQOA", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}
{"text": "Boy do I have a few things to say about this place.  We had a large group before a theater show and I was excited to try a new place.  It's conveniently located for all downtown events.  They also have happy hour which is always nice.  Our large group was seated in a back room with two waiters.  One had about 40 years working there, the other had 2 months.  I got the one with 2 months, go figure.\n\nI'm on a budget right now and pretty healthy, so I planned ahead to get a caesar salad.  I decided at the time to add \"shrimp\" (quoted on the menu as $2.50) and get a side of vegetables.  Now, the waiter said a lot of the dishes came with vegetables.  So I can order a side of them, right?  WRONG.  After I ordered, the waiter came back twice.  Once to tell me that they couldn't do the veggies.  Uh, what?  The second time to ask me how many shrimp I wanted.  hmm.  And he never refilled my water or asked if I wanted a drink.\n\nSo our food comes out and my salad is LEAVES and DRESSING.  Period.  The End.  Oh, with 3 pitiful shrimp on top.  That's it.  There was the powder parmesan on the table which I added myself.  So now I have 3 half broken, unseasoned, boiled shrimp with tails, lettuce and dressing.  Actually, everyone's food looked rather 'sad'.  Oh, but wait until I got my bill!!!\n\nMy lettuce, 3 pitiful shrimp, and self added powder parmesan was $18!!!!  The shrimp were $2.50 A PIECE.  For real real.  I wanted to throw down.  I could have had the salmon platter plus pasta for that.  What a rip off and so much for my budget.  \n\nWe had a big group but  my bill didn't have the tip added.  I was not happy with our idiot novice server so my tip would have been small.  Well, he brought me the credit card receipt and wrote in a tip himself.  Get me out of here!  Oh and because we were a 'group' they wouldn't accept one woman's coupon.  Weird.\n\nThe place is cool.  It's an old brothel and it's fun to look around.  But the upstairs is about 40 degrees colder than the downstairs.  The place is dated, but I liked it.  Intimate and creeky.  But jeez, go just for happy hour or a drink.  Don't put yourself through the misery and expense of what they call dinner. First off, I cannot comment on the food.\n\nI went on a Sat at 6.00 thinking it was early enough to not be too busy.  I had checked THEIR website about reservations and didn't see anything so assumed they didn't take them.  We wanted to sit at the bar anyway.  When we got there, the place was about 1/2 full at best.  He told us there were no open reservations until 9.00 (then why is the place half empty?)\n\nThat was fine by us, we wanted to be at the bar which had NO ONE AT IT.  He told us that to sit at the (empty) bar, we had to spend $50/person minimum.  WHAT?!  Now, I was prepared to spend some money, believe me, but what if I don't like the menu or I run out of time for dessert?  So, we weren't allowed to sit at the bar or a table.  We were pretty shocked so went somewhere else that didn't have a minimum spending to sit at a fuller bar.  \n\nI will never go back.  They completely turned two cute girls away that were ready to spend probably $80 in 45 min and had a pretentious attitude about it.", "user_id": "uuLupDHtM4udVEc3TtbLIw", "business_id": "SzHTdZR3yY1WBYUxkVxmUQ"}
{"text": "When it comes to the high-end chain steakhouses, Morton's and Capital Grille are great.  They consistently deliver great steaks and dependable apps, sides, and desserts.  However, my first and forever true love for steaks will always be Ruth's Chris.  I can still remember my first trip there in high school after my buddy's dad took us there to celebrate graduation.  As the 500 degree plate came out with the glorious aroma of perfectly cooked meat sizzling in butter, I knew I was not only in for something special, but a livelong love.\n\nRuth's Chris is a franchise and the setting in different cities can be quite variable.  The Philadelphia Ruth's Chris is right next to the Academy of Music with gas lamps lighting Broad St.  The Boston's Ruth's Chris is in old city hall with a beautiful ceiling 2 stories up in the bar area.  Pittsburgh's Ruth's Chris cannot boast such extravagance in their setting, but the food is equally outstanding in all their restaurants.\n\nMy recent venture to Ruth's Chris was with 4 other young men in a \"guys night out.\"  I brought several bottles of wine (you have to love the PA Chairman's selection) because Ruth's Chris amazingly allows you to do this.  We started with the seared Ahi tuna.  It was raw, thick, and delicious.  Actually, it kind of tasted like steak.\n\nWe each went on to get various cuts of meat.  I personally rolled with my favorite:  NY Strip, medium rare (correctly done with a blood red center), extra butter.  The extra butter is key.  If you're going to roll with a decadent feast of steak, might as well pull out all the stops.  It was brought out absolutely perfect and delicious.  The table also shared the excellent huge family-style sides of asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes.\n\nOur server was extremely gracious.  She opened and decanted a couple of our bigger bottles as soon as we sat down to give them time to breathe.  They arranged for us to have a cab-van at the end of our meal to take us to our next location.  \n\nIf I was really searching for something negative to say, it's that I wish that the Pittsburgh Ruth's Chris was in a more extravagant setting like some bigger cities.  However, since the main menu is exactly the same, Ruth's Chris is forever my go-to location for a perfect steak dinner. I feel like this place is right out of a Seinfeld episode.  It's in a tiny space on Penn Ave in Lawrenceville.  Tram is a gentleman who doesn't like it if you're not ready to order immediately when he comes to your table.  Because you only get about 2 minutes to look at the menu, the pressure's on when you sit down!\n\nThe food here is tasty and inexpensive.  The Pho is perfect on a cold winter day.  I'll agree with other reviewers that the spring rolls are delicious as well.\n\nIt gets pretty crowded during the weekday lunch rush.  Recommended if you're in the neighborhood! I'm going to start off by making the very bold statement that for most of last 10 years, Umi has been the best restaurant in Pittsburgh.  It's not just the best Japanese restaurant (which it is by an extraordinarily wide margin), but the best overall restaurant in the city.  Why such acclaim you might ask?  The answer lies in Umi's consistency in providing delicious cuisine with outstanding service.\n\nI'm embarrassed to say it, but when I first went to Umi about 10 years ago (has it been that long already?), I didn't like sushi.  I thought the texture was strange and it tasted too fishy.  The first time I had the omakase at Umi, the veil was lifted over my eyes.  Never had I imagined that Japanese food could be so delicious!  The constantly changing flavors and textures with each subsequent course was mind-spinning.  It would not be hyperbole to say that it was life-altering because it opened my eyes to the world of finer cuisine and made me want to seek out foods that I had been too afraid or stubborn to try in the past.\n\nOn a recent visit to Umi, I was surprised to see that there had been a change to the omakase menu.  It was always as big as you wanted to make it (like Troy Polamalu who likes the $250/person omakase), but now there were 3 options of a 7-course plus dessert, an 11-course plus dessert, and a \"trust Mr. Shu\" omakase.  When I inquired what that meant, they said \"that's what the Steelers get.\"\n\nOn this occasion, my buddy and I got the 11-course omakase.  It was delicious as always and included a dizzying array of sashimi preparations, the much-acclaimed miso cod, and spicy and tender rock shrip tempura.  A very pleasant surprise was a new course served in two spoons.  One had poached lobster and the other had Kobe beef.  Each was covered with fois gras.  This was absolutely decadent and brought back memories for me of the fois gras sushi in O-Ya in Boston (which was the New York Times best new restaurant in the U.S. a few years ago).\n\nUmi's biggest criticism has always been that it's too expensive.  Although it's true that it can easily be the most expensive restaurant in Pittsburgh, you absolutely are getting your money's worth.  From very personal (and somewhat disappointing experience), high-end Japanese restaurants in bigger cities are just as good as Umi but MUCH more expensive (like sometimes twice as expensive).  I'll also make the bold statement that for what you get, Umi is a steal and Pittsburgh has been very lucky to have it.\n\nService is always outstanding.  On my most recent visit, Drew was our waiter who in my opinion is one of the nicest and best waiters in the city.  That really adds to the experience.  Also on my most recent visit to Umi, I was very pleasantly surprised that they had a free valet!  Parking has always been terrible in that portion of Ellsworth Ave.  The valet made it so simple, and it was free!  Kudos to Big Burrito for making that outstanding decision.\n\nI don't think it's fair to blame the restaurant for not seating you if you don't have a reservation.  Umi is very small and is always very crowded on the weekends.  As mentioned in other reviews, you can sit at the normal tables or the sunken \"traditional\" Japanese tables.  Some advice from my wife is that if you're wearing a dress, don't sit at the sunken tables.  When you get up, you might be revealing more than you intend!", "user_id": "dLSjb4_VFZz07xBcsR4BiA", "business_id": "0FgwBx7pgmNdUtsd_T8UYQ"}
{"text": "Yes, I know.  I'm probably one of the few people that has rated this place with two stars.\n\nBut let me explain.  My friends and I wanted to try this place out and had high hopes.  I haven't heard of many vegetarian/vegan places in Pittsburgh so I expected to have some awesome vegetarian food.  However, from the get go, our host was absolutely terrible.  He did not look us in the eye and was just overall awkward.  There was obviously room in the restaurant for the four of us but he had to \"look in the back\" to see if there was room.  One of the other servers eventually sat us in a clearly empty table that we could have picked out for ourselves.  Our first host came back, reiterated the same thing the server told us, but never gave us menus.  I had to go out of my way to ask for menus about five or ten minutes after we had been seated.\n\nTo be fair, our assigned server was very nice.  She was friendly and approachable.  But of course, our food came and mine was cold.  The potatoes in the hash I ordered was stale, old and cold and had such a small accompanying serving of bread.  Also, our utensils weren't given to us until after our food was served.  I know I may be sounding like a little bit of a snob but utensils should be expected before the food arrives.  Not to be completely biased, the rest my party had decent food.  It just wasn't anything special.  Definitely not worth $12 for brunch.\n\nNeedless to say, I will not be coming back to this place. I wanted to visit Umi at least twice before I felt like I could write a review.  Not to sound like a snob (just trying to emphasize a point here), but I am originally from Southern California and can honestly say I have tried some of the best sushi and sashimi around.  After visiting Umi twice now, I can, for a fact, say that I have had the best fish here.  I cannot emphasize how flavorful and fresh the sushi and sashimi is!  \n\nOf course, the freshness of the food doesn't come cheap.  I have been here twice with my boyfriend and our bill, excluding drinks, has always exceeded $100.  Servings are on the smaller side so you have to get a couple of entrees.  \n\nAnyway, the last time we went to Umi was on Valentine's Day.  I have a feeling that making reservations is always the way to go for this place, especially on special occasions and holidays.  During our visit, we got the oyster sashimi, miso soup, mixed seaweed salad, squid \"pasta\" with garlic sauce, the assorted sashimi entree and two different kinds of makis.  In addition, we also shared a dessert brought up from the Soba Lounge downstairs (Umi shares a delicious dessert menu with Soba).  There were only three oysters that came with one $15 order... I was a bit disappointed until I actually ate one.  It was the freshest oyster I have ever had and I am not exaggerating.  Also, another pleasant surprise for me was despite the fact that the assorted sashimi entree was only supposed to come with one serving of miso soup and salad, our server (during both visits) served the both of us with the soup and salad without having to be asked.  I thought that was pretty neat.  The miso soup tasted like it was made from scratch.  I could taste the flavor of the miso and the soup was not too salty or watery.  The texture of the seaweed salad was what I expected it to be.  I mean, you can't really go wrong with a seaweed salad, right?  The squid \"pasta\" was just like how the name made it sound - squid that was thinly sliced like pasta, served with a sort of buttery, garlic, ponzu sauce.  They served this with white rice on the side. The sashimi entree had five different types of sashimi: red snapper, yellowtail, mackarel, tuna, and salmon.  Goodness, I could go on and on about how absolutely delicious the sashimi was but I will not waste your time and just tell you to try it for yourself.  That is, if you are a fan of raw fish.  The makis we got were in small portions but were also delicious.\n\nIf I could go back and eat at Umi every weekend, I would.  Alas, the prices do not fit my meager monthly budget.  However, Umi will always make the top of my list when dining out for special occasions.", "user_id": "cHzrY4ci7jvRb850Yiw7FA", "business_id": "PzG0XmAmtXFs6Fdnubf41g"}
{"text": "Seriously, terrible.  Just all around terrible.\n\nWe've been to the OFM twice now... the first visit was acceptable, but the second was absolutely terrible.  We had late reservations for a quick bite after a lovely night at the O'Reilly to celebrate my husband's birthday.  As sushi lovers, we thought this would be a great way to end the celebration.  We sat at the sushi bar and couldn't get the attention of our waitress or the sushi chef.  After an exhausting 20+ min wait in our seats and just as I was about to go find someone, we finally were able to place our order.  \n\nAgain... waiting, waiting.  Oh, our wait was enhanced by guests of the hotel (tweens loaded with makeup from what appeared to be dance competition and their drunk parents) standing behind us. No, they were not eating, they were just standing there... yelling, at 11pm.  \n\n\nOur server returned to bring my husband's glass of warm white wine and commented on how terrible our experience must be, but did nothing to help... no drink refills, no offer to call the manager, nothing.   Hubby sent the 14$ glass of bath water, I mean, wine, back to the bar, only to have it replaced with, you guessed it! another glass of warm white wine.  \n\nOur sushi was finally ready and it was edible but not enjoyable...  no flavor in the fish and hard rice.  We left before finishing our 40$ meal (1 glass of wine, 1 water, 1 roll, 2 orders of sashimi).  \n\nI almost asked for the manager, but frankly was tired of waiting and just wanted to get out of there.  To top it off, we paid $12 for valet parking that would not be validated unless we spent $50 at the restaurant.  We will not give it another chance and suggest you don't give it a first. The best sushi in Pittsburgh, without question.  This little gem is nestled in the heart of Mt. Lebanon.  My husband was raised in MtL and has been eating at this place for as long as he can remember.  He introduced me to it when we were dating and it has become our go-to place. \n\nWe've learned the hard way that sushi in Pittsburgh is best served HERE.  The fish is flavorful and bright and the sushi is artfully crafted.  I've sampled a few non-sushi dishes, but stick with the raw stuff because, well, it's pure heaven.  We have our favorites - black marlin and yellow tail sashimi, eel nigiri and the spicy tuna and philly (fresh salmon, only!) rolls.  We just discovered the spicy scallop in seaweed and it is to die for.  \n\nWe went through a phase during which we celebrated milestones (birthdays, promotions, etc) at different \"hot spots\" around the city and were always left a bit disappointed.  Don't get me wrong, we certainly eat elsewhere, but our celebratory dinners are always with Frank, et al @ LT. \n\nNow, I'm not wearing blinders and certainly recognize that the place on Ellsworth in SHY is higher end and offers a more elegant experience, but the quality of the fish really isn't that different... not to mention, who splurges for that on a regular basis?  \n\nLook no further (and skip the craziness and mediocrity of Nakama) and go to LT.  Just don't take our spot at the sushi bar! i've been to Umi for sushi several times and haven't been disappointed in the quality of the fish.  yes, it's delicious and high quality food.. so why the four stars you ask? \n\nbecause it's just a bit too pretentious for my taste.  yes, it's great quality fish and yes, the decor is very traditionally beautiful japanese... but what you read about the snobbery is true... 50$pp minimum @ the sushi bar? please.  \n\ni agree with a previous reviewer, it's beautiful, high quality food and service... but i always leave feeling like something is missing.", "user_id": "LrsSrB-slOwoKCl5wZw3AQ", "business_id": "z4cCguoHdU48pj6sXMIzqg"}
{"text": "Outstanding meal.  Will absolutely go back.  \n\nRestaurant is small with very busy/tight space vibe.  Try antipasto appetizer if available when you go.  Also, the meatball appetizer is kind of a signature item to this establishment, so absolutely try as well.  All entrees comes with salad and pasta, so come ready for a big meal that will be worth every calorie, every bite.   We had veal and duck entrees and they really were quite deliciously special.  Lots of leftovers came home with us.  \n\nArea not so shady, so don't let this discourage you.  They have Valet as well, which makes parking easy. We kept being told that Umi is hands down the best sushi in Pittsburgh, so the expectation was already there.  People get really territorial about sushi and what is qualified as \"the best\" in each of our heads.\n\nAs for Umi, they get high marks in my opinion for for quality of sushi, quality of toro specifically, taste of rock shrimp entree and sea bass with miso.  Our server Benjamin was friendly, delightful and professional as well.  \n\nIt was good and I am glad we went to experience Umi, but life is about managing expectations and despite my 3 stars, I too am not sure if I would go back.\n\nI want to give it 4 stars on food alone, but the negative points which made me more inclined to give it 3 stars were:\n\n1) only being able to get a reservation past 9pm any day of the week for many weeks in advance on Open Table (built up my expectation of what I thought Umi would be)\n\n2) being turned away from Valet at our 9pm arrival because it was full (again, built up my expectation of how in demand Umi is)\n\n3) the long flights of stairs to reach the restaurant is a haul if you don't like or cannot walk stairs with ease.  Although we are fit and able, we were advised that there is not an elevator to get patrons to the restaurant, but a person could be served Umi menu from Soba restaurant on first floor.  Not sure where the ADA compliance is here, but even if they are up to code, seems bizarre in the 21st century to hear from someone that it is almost incredibly inconvenient to show up with an issue that would prohibit you from walking up stairs in order to be served at Umi.  But regardless, \"stairway to almost heaven\" again almost feeds into to expectation of \"what is at the top\" and what my experience will be. \n\n4)  venue space is indeed small and thus explains limited reservations.  It is a calming, welcoming, dimly lit designed room...felt cool, hip, modern in a way.\n\n5)  sushi quality was indeed there, but sushi portions are indeed small.  The Rainbow Roll is my barometer on sushi and thus my bar on comparing one sushi establishment to another.  Portions do not need to be large to be considered great when it comes to sushi, but for $27 for a Rainbow Roll, the expectation is there that this is going to be so amazing it is going to rock my world.   Quality was very good, roll was very fresh, but not $27 good.  The slices of fish on top of roll were too thin to be warrant the price.  I am happy to pay $27, but the restaurant set my expectation up and I was a little disappointed.  If the Rainbow Roll was $20, I might feel differently.  \n\nLife is about managing expectations, so go to Umi and try it for yourself and you be the judge and write your own review.", "user_id": "D9_Z7NgKHOC4jJLhXujrOw", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g"}
{"text": "First, I have to say that I've been here twice in the past few months, and each time was with a very large group (one group of 20, one group of over 30) on a weekend evening and I'm thoroughly impressed with the friendly, efficient and professional manner in which the accommodate groups. Whether increasing the number of diners at the last minute or providing separate checks, they are flawless. Lots of other restaurants could learn from them. Impressively, even with providing separate checks to such large groups, they chose not to add gratuity (and we obliged with good tips), l managed to deliver food to everyone at the same time, and processed payment of the checks in no time at all. Bravo to this restaurant's management and service staff, it's top notch.\n\nThat being said, the food and beer aint all that bad either! Fish & Chips, chicken mac'n cheese, salmon bites, guacamole and the Maker's Mark burger are all quite good, as are the beers (the K\u00f6lsch is my favorite!). Casbah has one of the most consistent kitchens in Pittsburgh. The menu only changes slightly from time to time, but it's always full of great options and the quality and preparation of the food is always top notch. The service doesn't disappoint either. I'm always amazed that they can nail it (food and service) every single time without fail. The bar area is a great place for drinks or dinner as well. Fiona behind the bar is always welcoming and fun and is perhaps one of the best bartenders in the city. It's also one of only a handful of good restaurants in the city that is open on Sundays. Now if only they would replace the swivel bar stools that are bolted to the ground and make it challenging for some (especially smaller women) to dine while sitting at the bar or for couples to sit as close to one another as they'd prefer. Olive or Twist is convenient place to go before or after shows in Pittsburgh's Cultural District or Pirates baseball games. The inside is very nice, pleasant and comfortable. I was there on a Friday. The entertainment was excellent (a one-man band by the name of Mark Pipas -- who played music from all genres and rarely took breaks). The bar tenders are friendly and make great drinks, but if the place gets busy -- be warned -- the service can be tragically slow. I didn't have food, but the food that I saw looked good. My biggest complaint is the drink prices. I realize that this is a downtown establishment. It's somewhat upscale, but it's not the Ritz. I'm not at all cheap, but $4.25 for an IC Light, $7.75 for a normal-size Captain and Coke and $7.75 for a shot of Jaeger (though it was a generous pour), is a bit high for such a social bar in Pittsburgh, even if it's downtown, and even if it's somewhat upscale. Located somewhat obscurely on the third floor of Soba, Umi's sister restaurant, this is the finest upscale place in Pittsburgh for sushi. All of parent company Big Burrito's restaurants have a high standard, but at Umi one quickly forgets that it's part of a larger entity, as it's so chef-driven. It's my understanding that Umi is only open when Mr. Shu is there, which explains why it's only open five days a week and closes for a summer vacation. The Omakase option is simply awesome. There's an 11-course and seven-course option. I've only had the 11 and it's excellent. Some of the courses look similar to one another with two or three pieces of fish, but the tastes and preparations definitely differ. My only complaint about it is that I wish it would change more from time to time. As it is, many courses are the same each time (even many months apart), including the chef's spoons (lobster and kobe beef), rock shrimp tempura and miso cod, with some of the other course with pieces of fish varying. I've been told that the seven-course options is only the same, but that the 11 varies, presumably in those additional four courses. More frequent and drastic changes would certainly keep me coming back. The service is always totally on-point, regardless of servers, though Larry, who has worked there a long time tends to be popular. There's a great sake list as well. Make sure your wallet is full.

{"text": "This place is nestled in a nice location next to the city water reservoir and highland park, making it a great place to grab a coffee if you are out for a morning walk. It offers a clean and casual interior and draws a more eclectic crowd than most cafes- leans a bit towards the business casual crowd. Still ha that neighborhood feel though. I have never had food there though they offer paninis. Great desserts. Good espressos and okay coffee.Outdoor seating. Good place to study. Plenty of laptop outlets and free wireless. This is a great place to go if you're in the 'burgh. This small joint expanded in the last year. great dogs and a huge selection of beer, imported and otherwise. Service has always been decent and better. Sports agames are often on the TV so get ready for that. Atmosphere is pretty neat- there's a weird mural in the larger seating area that's worth a peek and a air duct in top of the room that's cleverly painted like a wooden beam- can't get over that. I am a fan. Go here- then go catch a movie at Regent Square theater up the street. Glad to write this review to counter the only other one which is not so enthused... Pho Minh is a small family run place. Family is usually present and it's nice to see the kids hang out and help in the restaurant from time to time.  \n\nMeal starts with free tea served as you are seated. Food is slow to some out but they make it to order and it is a small staff so it's to be expected. It is definitely not a place to go if you need to get in and get out fast. This is a sit down and chat kind of place. \n\nThis is another of my \" I'm sick and need a spicy soup\" strongholds. I suggest the vermicelli soup. I used to stop in here just to buy a few fresh rolls and know I am among several others who do this.\n\nPho Minh won't blow you away it's just a good place to get some Vietnamese food and meet with friends- which is reason enough for me to return. Like the owner. Informal atmosphere- almost Asian cafeteria style except the food is really good. Decor is a little disjointed. Cheap prices so I'm not complaining. Always fast service. Good place for a casual hang out w/ friends or a not-out-to-impress date. Do not add fish sauce to stuff- it almost ruined my Tram's proclivity forever.\n\nGood place to get a spicy hot soup in the winter if you're cold.\n\nSeems good for large groups. Cash only I think... Eaten here many times. Family run and they remember you so if you come back time and time again they start putting treats in your to go bag- weird treats though- like a brownie- but I'm not complaining. Food is good. Has sort of a Asian fusion menu actually but staple Thai items. Service is always friendly. Casual dress. Interesting interior with lots to look at on the walls.Good for groups. Good place for a relaxed dinner. I had heard of \"bacon night\" from a friend and ended up going to the Harris Grille with some out of towners, hoping we could pull off a memorable bacon-y Pittsburgh experience. Though I'm told others have had better luck our server was forgetful and many jokes were made to explain time and time again why no bacon had appeared. I'd say skip the bacon night. Other wise the turkey burger I had was affordable and tasty with a salad on the side. I had an organic Oatmeal ale that I would recommend. The menu was humorous and others at my table were also pleased with their food. It's a step up from standard bar food and not greasy which is a +. The interior was dark- too dark for my tastes unless your on a date and after that mood. Outside was nice- they ran out of seating shortly after we arrived and several people stood around us, but again, maybe this was an effect of bacon night. Enjoyable enough. I would go back- good chill spot for a group if you can wrangle seats.", "user_id": "dyFP7vRPhUofhQMzID_h_g", "business_id": "83_p9vIqOq1TUIf3_GD7bA"}
{"text": "Totally underrated by the Yelpers!\n\nI freakin' LOVE Redfin Blues.  I'm kind of glad it had a low rating previously to keep y'all away while I was living in Pittsburgh!  The only reason I'm even reviewing it now is because I have moved away and I'm not at risk for losing my table to a Yelp reader.  Also, I feel guilty at not letting people in on this gem.\n\nTo be clear, I LOVE Redfin Blues for a very SPECIFIC purpose: sitting outside on the patio by the water on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon drinking the bar out of Red Stripe and white wine and eating peel and eat shrimp by the 2 pound bowl with B, Ems, Boyfriend, and whoever else is so lucky.  It is a hidden gorgeous Pittsburgh oasis under the 31st bridge near Washington's Landing (note: the Yelp map is wrong) where you don't feel at all like you're in Pittsburgh, but instead on vacation.\n\nDisclaimer: I have heard that at night it is full of strange frat boys (from no actual fraternity), Cougars, tramps, creatures of the night  -- or undesirables.  I don't go at night so my credibility wanes here a little.\n\nI basically only ever eat the peel and eat shrimp.  It's just cooked shrimp - sometimes it's big, sometimes it's little.  But it's $17 for TWO pounds which isn't too overpriced especially since it can feed a tableful of friends.  Ask for extra old bay if you like it spicy and salty - yum! I've also had the fried cod sandwich - the fish is crisp and flaky and darn good!  I always take it off the bread to keep it as crispy as possible but those who know me know I have an obsession with fried crispy-ness.  The breading isn't too too heavy so that is a plus too.  I've also had the crab cakes which are meh  but fine for Pittsburgh standards and I would definitely steer clear of the crab legs.  \n\nOk, so really you should go to this place - if you like peel and eat shrimp, cold drinks by the river, and occasionally a keyboardist who plays and sings in the background pretty quietly.  Some of my favorite Pittsburgh moments happened here and that's saying a LOT.  Redfin Blues makes me miss you Pittsburgh! I eat at Harris' all the time.  I don't even MEAN to, I just happen to end up here a lot.  I think it's because it's the kind of place that lots of people can agree on - pretty good food and drinks and a KILLER patio.  For me, the patio kicks it up from 4 to 5 stars.  in the winter they don't serve lunch.  In the summer this place is hoppin' all the time and yes, I'm that jerk hogging a giant table waiting for my friends to show up - they're just PARKING.\n\n(speaking of parking - don't park in the lot next door you WILL get towed!)\n\nNone of the other reviews mentioned yet that they recently changed the menu - one of the great new additions is the BBQ pork sandwich.  I love it in slider form - get the coleslaw with it and stick it on the sando.  delish.  I don't even LIKE coleslaw - including on a primanti's bros sando - so you know it's good.\n\nThe mac and cheese (add the andouille sausage!) is a staple and you can get a mini version as a side to an entree for just a little extra.  \n\nAnother new addition is the chicken fried bacon - yes, you read that correctly.  It is a hearty plate of bacon that is battered and fried and comes with white gravy.  I've shared it 3 times with friends and each time it's been a little different but also kind of left me a little queasy although with a happy novelty food feeling.  I would definitely not recommend one person trying to eat this unless they were trying to commit suicide by bacon - which I also don't recommend - and I LOVE bacon.   \n\nOverall I love this place and I don't think the drinks are more expensive than most of the other places on Ellsworth - half price frozen cosmos are definitely worth it.  Service is also usually great.", "user_id": "HZR4YmkZml_o-aAtKxWcRQ", "business_id": "41CXLCeB8z2oNdIOvnrzIA"}
{"text": "I went here on a Friday afternoon for lunch with some coworkers. We were a party of 12. Even though the restaurant was busy, they were able to get us a table. Apparently there is a second floor room that can be rented out for parties, but they don't take reservations. \n\nThe interior of the building is nicer than I thought, judging from the outside and other Yelp reviews. They have a lot of large televisions, which would make this an ideal spot for watching a game. \n\nOur server was very pleasant and friendly, but some of the staff has that native Pittsburgher gruffness, which some people might translate as rude. There do seem to be some staffing problems, though. A latecomer to our group asked another waitress clearing a nearby table if she was our waitress. The woman said \"no\" and walked away without offering to get our server. It was a little weird. Our waitress also had people at the other end of the table yell their lunch orders, even though it was very loud. She could have easily walked over, so that was odd, too. \n\nNot being in the mood for fish, I ordered the white pizza. It was very large, much bigger than I expected. I ended up taking the leftovers with me, and it fed me for two more meals. So, while the prices are a little more than you'd expect to pay at a similar restaurant, many of the portions are huge. Two people could easily split the fish sandwich.\n\n The pizza was pretty good, with a paper-thin crust and plenty of tomatoes and pungent garlic. I think the garlic was from a jar. The cheese was a tangy blend. \n\nAll of Roland's pizzas are oven-fired, and some of my pieces of crust were burned black. This may be a plus to some people, but I don't much care for it. \n\nIn all, it was a decent meal, and the rest of my party seemed to be happy with their food. I'd like to come back here and try some other menu items. I've had better burgers at several other Pittsburgh restaurants. I have never eaten anything else on the Tessaro menu--and since it doesn't look very appealing, it's not likely that I will--but the burgers are just OK. The service, in my opinion, is often quite rude. The \"ambiance\" is loud, dark, dingy and depressing. Sorry, but I just don't get it. For a better hamburger, try the Sharp Edge Beer Emporium, Murray Avenue Grill, or even Five Guys Burgers and Fries. This is my favorite Thai Restaurant in Pittsburgh.  The building may not look like much, but the food is excellent.  The only dish I have ever disliked was the duck curry.  Everything else has been superb. The prices are reasonable and the servers are friendly, too.  It often gets quite crowded on weekends, but the wait is never too long.  BYOB. I have only eaten a full meal in the dining room once; but I have ordered appetizers and drinks in the comfortable bar area more than a handful of times. On the occasion of the dinner, a dining companion's seared rare tuna was really excellent; I'd recommend ordering that. As for appetizers, I like the lobster maki and the crispy tofu. They also have a great wine list and some good cocktails (I enjoy the plum sangria). \n\nIn all, first class food, drinks, service and decor. Now if they could just do something about all the pretentious people who flood the place... I used to come here at least once a week for happy hour--now I go about once a month. The draw is mainly the patio and the happy hour. They also have a great draft selection and most people admit to liking the frozen cosmos (the rest are just lying). I've never had their brunch so I can't weigh in, but I love the baby burgers and spinach and artichoke dip. Most of their food is good. They have a tendency to over cook the regular size burgers. Tuesday nights are bacon night, and it's delicious bacon--some of the best I've ever had. \n\nThe service and waiting time for a seat can be a serious drawback. Some of the wait staff are great, others no so much. But it's still a fun neighborhood bar with lots of charm and personality.", "user_id": "RdGUUb4lwCC0wHIMbL3dZg", "business_id": "wHi8ODv7TGmeUB02XoX-mA"}
{"text": "Worst pizza I've had in Pittsburgh. I ordered from here last weekend. The pizza (pepperoni) had no flavor and the crust was way too chewy. The Buffalo wings were cooked well, and were tender and juicy, but they had almost no sauce on them whatsoever; luckily I had some wing sauce in my fridge in order to save them. \n\nMaybe it was one bad night, and I can give them another chance later, but based on my one experience, I can't recommend this place to anyone. I'm a big fan of all the Big Burrito restaurants I've tried (Eleven, Umi, Mad Mex & Casbah). I think Eleven is my favorite, but Casbah is a very close second. \n\nMy most recent trip was with my wife on 1/15/10. We started with the grilled flat bread and the butternut squash ravioli. For entrees, I had the Casbah twice cut pork chop and my wife had a pasta dish with sausage and ricotta. For dessert, I had the creme brulee and my wife had the espresso ice cream / cookie (it was really just a fancy chipwich). \n\nThe grilled flat bread came with three different dips, Humus, Red Pepper Hummus, and Baba Ganoush. I really enjoyed all three, but thought the Red Pepper Hummus stood out as the best, although if you're not a fan of garlic you may disagree. The butternut squash ravioli didn't impress me much, but my wife really liked it. \n\nAs far as the entrees, we both really enjoyed our meals. My pork chop was cooked perfectly, and was anything but dry. The sage aioli that it was topped with added an excellent flavor. The sides were kale, and butternut squash risotto, both of which really shined. I can't describe how amazing the risotto was, and the kale was extremely flavorful. \n\nI tried my wife's pasta dish, and overall I thought it was good, but the sausage was really outstanding. Incredibly tender and flavorful. \n\nNeither of us were too impressed with our desserts. The creme brulee was very good, but at that point, I expected it to be great. My wife's dessert sort of disappointed, since the cookies were dry. \n\nThe bill for everything listed above, plus a bottle of red wine (~$35) was $120 before tip, so it is pricey, but in my opinion totally worth it. \n\nAlso, our server was very attentive and helpful, without being intrusive. I asked his opinion on the French Malbec and he gave me his honest opinion, which was negative. One of the best casual restaurants in Shadyside, and to echo a previous reviewer, always at the top of my list when I want someplace walkable.  \n\nMy most recent trip was this past Saturday (1/23/10).  I was hoping that the unseasonably warm weather would make for good outdoor dining on their awesome patio (I'm pretty sure they were voted near the top for outdoor dining in one of the local Pittsburgh magazines) however, the rest of my party nixed that idea.\n\nMy usual order includes the mini pulled-pork sandwiches (swine & dandies), the mini crab cake sandwiches (crabby-patties), a side of the macaroni and cheese (I defy you to find better mac & cheese in Pittsburgh) and the buffalo wing dip.  I would highly recommend any of these dishes.\n\nThis trip, I tried the pierogies for the first time.  They were decent, although they seemed a little overcooked on the outside (too much time in the frying pan).  I also had the full sized pulled pork sandwich and a side of the aforementioned mac & cheese.  As usual, these were great.  \n\nI definitely recommend giving this place a try.  As other reviewers said, the frozen Cosmo's are great, and definitely add the shot.  For beer drinkers, their prices are somewhere between fair and overpriced, but they have a very large selection of unique bottled beers.", "user_id": "DX_byrz0UkiaGDHjDK46jQ", "business_id": "B9C6j80ob0f1pwi1Cnnd1Q"}
{"text": "It's a shame that some of the other reviewers had poor experiences. I discovered Pino's after deciding that the wait for Point Brugge simply wasn't worth it.\n\nThe brunch was very good, I enjoyed the atmosphere, particularly the \"missing\" wall which gives the appearance of outdoor seating, and particularly liked not having to sit shoulder-to-shoulder with other people.\n\nMy sole comment would be that the owner, who was very friendly, should let his food speak for itself rather than being so concerned about the neighborhood competition. The coffee here is amazing (I love when the baristas take the effort to make patterns in the foam). The baristas were extremely friendly and the pastries looked delicious. While there are a number of tables, Enrico's was busy even on a Friday night...I would imagine that it would be hard to find a table during peak hours. Wednesday is Wing night, i.e., eat your face off night. For ~ $9 you can eat unlimited wings (with your choice of various sauces) for several hours. If you can, top it off with a brownie - they're quite good.\n\nI've mostly had the wings at Blues & I like all of the sauces, but the burgers are good, as well. Whatever you do, make sure to get the sweet potato fries & tip your waitress! (Especially if her name is Meg). I ate here in January and was very impressed. We ate in the basement, although Casbah has two floors and outdoor seating. I thought the atmosphere was very good, and the fish (I forget the exact dish) was well-prepared.\n\nThis is on the expensive side, but worth it for a special occasion. Enter into D's (after figuring out the correct door - I still make this mistake) and you'll be greeted by a long draft bar. For Chrissakes, they have Delirium on tap! The real jewel, though, is in the back. You have the beer cave with hundreds of different types of cold beers for carry out, or you can build your own six pack from the unchilled beers and chill them on the spot. D's is still the only place I've ever found the elusive Hopfenweisen by SchneiderWeiss and Brooklyn Brewery, perhaps the best beer I've ever had.\n\nWhile D's is worth it for the beer alone, the food's not bad either. The pizza is average, but they truly do have the best hot dogs in the city.\n\nFinally, bring a growler or buy one of theirs. Prices are reasonable and the selection is outstanding. Let's see....an Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh in the heart of the strip named after a woman with her own Italian cooking show? Should be great, right? Not so much.\n\nWent here recently and ordered the pasta trio, since this is apparently what one gets at Lidias. Perhaps I went on the wrong day, but I thought that the three pastas (bolognese sauce, pesto sauce, and gnocchi with sage butter) were underwhelming. At the very least, there are Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh that offer much better food for a similar price.\n\nThe one positive to Lidia's was the dessert - which was fantastic. I had a bite of a chocolate torte, and was very impressed. The coffee with grappa was also quite nice.\n\nAll things told, though, I would spend my money elsewhere. I used to be a regular at Harris Grill until I moved a bit further away, but I still try to return for the I Can Haz Bacon Cheesburger and Bacon night. Where else can you go on a Tuesday and order a side of bacon with your meal?\n\nWhile Harris isn't the only place in Pittsburgh where you can get your drinks delivered to you by a cute hipster waitstaff, it certainly has one of the widest & best beer selections in the city.

{"text": "I'm usually a fan of what Big Burrito does around Pittsburgh, yet I can't fully recommend Soba to the Asian food enthusiast. While the space and service warrant a 4.5 star rating, one can summarize most dishes as high quality yet forgettable rip-offs.\n\nNot that this designation makes sense or anything at this point, but read on. I'm not going to go into the details of the dishes I ate, as they probably won't be on the menu in the near future. Soba's seasonality is something that makes it stand out, and I appreciate the sourcing of the ingredients. Speaking of the ingredients, everything is a rather high quality, which is to be expected at the price point. My scallops were deliciously meaty and sugar sweet, and my vegetarian dining companion's vegetables all tasted quite fresh. The rhubarb in my desert had a perfectly tangy, subtly sweet flavor. Proteins and veggies stand out.\n\nBut the dishes, as a whole, don't warrant the price point. Soba tries to communicate subtlety in flavoring of its food, and it carries this principle of subtlety a bit too far. In fact, the food ends up being on the slightly bland, underseasoned side more often than not. For example, the broth in my entree tasted only vaguely of the soy and ginger promised, and my friend's red curry exhibited anemic spicing. Flaws in execution are similarly prevalent; my noodles and my friend's rice were too mushy. Such flaws didn't detract too heavily from the dining experience, but when I'm paying $70+ (appetizer, dinner, dessert, and drink) for a meal I'm expecting complex flavor and texture contrasts, deft seasoning, and meticulous technique. To that end, Soba fails. The meal was fairly enjoyable, and perhaps I went on an off night, but my sticker shock for good but not great food has yet to subside. Don't understand the hype, as this place serves slightly above-average bar food in a hipsterish, semi-romantic atmosphere. I cannot comment on the bar and/or alcoholic beverages as I did not imbibe on my recent visit, but the menu didn't do much for me.\n\nWe arrived on a busy Saturday night, but were seated within 20 minutes. Not bad, but our table was questionable. They took a big, corner booth and split it in half so that 2 parties of four could be accommodated sitting directly across from each other. It was kind of weird obligatorily staring at the couple across from me, but I digress.\n\nSome of my fellow diners started off with the Vegetarian Chili. I sampled some and it was well-spiced and hearty, I didn't miss the meat. We also started off with the Spinach Dip. The dip itself was fine, though I've never really eaten anywhere that could screw up spinach dip.\n\nThe entrees then arrived. My companion decided to have their signature Mac and Cheese. The noodles were a perfect al dente, and the cheese itself had a sharp bite. It became difficult to eat after a few bites, however, for the dish was missing a textural contrast. It would've benefited from some breadcrumbs baked on top.\n\nI decided to sample their bacon cheeseburger, which the establishment is apparently pretty proud of. It was cooked to a true medium rare, which is a rare (no pun intended) find in this city. Also, the bacon was heavenly, an ideal combination of lean and fat. They take their bacon seriously here, and it was easily the most interesting part of the burger. The pros of the burger end there however. It was, besides the bacon, pretty boring. The accompaniments (lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, ketchup, mustard) were standard. The patty itself, while well-cooked and of a good quality, was unfortunately underseasoned. The burger could've benefited from something that gave it pizzaz, like a sauce, some spice, or even some more salt!\n\nI opted for onion rings as a side to my burger. They were large, battered, sweet, and a little crispy, though quite greasy.\n\nMaybe it was because it was a busy Saturday night that I was disappointed. I was expecting some high class bar food at this spot. The common theme of the meal was that although the dishes were competently executed, they all lacked something (such as textural contrast) that could've elevated them to true greatness.

{"text": "What's better than fresh, homemade free cookies?!\n\nWell, a gluten free cookie, but whatever, I can still enjoy myself in sharing free food with other people. \n\nMax & Erma's is like the place to get everything. If I'd ever been to an Eat N' Park I imagine it'd be like that except classier. Well, I don't know about classier, again I've never been to Eat N' Park. But back to Max & Erma's...\n\nThe location we went to always has a crowded parking lot. I don't know why it's so busy but there's hardly any parking there. Allot a few more minutes for parking. You'll need it.\n\nOnce you're in though it's super fun. Build your burger, eat greasy appetizers, and taste some delicious milkshakes. I've had the lunch special - soup or salad or half sandwich for pretty cheap. It's just enough food to not leave you in a food coma after lunch. The only thing I wish (and yes this took away a star) is that there were more sandwich options. So sometimes I get the soup & salad and I'm still hungry. That's a no bueno.\n\nThen there's dinner. Their burgers are kind of fantastic. I'm still not over the whole eating a rare cooked burger so everywhere in PA gets added bonus points for that. So overall it's a good burger, but it's certainly not the best burger I've ever eaten and there's nothing really creative about their burgers to make them stand apart from other place's burgers. \n\nThe atmosphere is something between a TGIFridays or Chili's but very Pittsburgh-centric. I found it somewhere between comforting and annoying. I don't really like chain restaurants but this one had some nice personal stuff to keep it from venturing into the Fridays realm.\n\nAlso, if you're a craft beer & burger sort a gal, you'll notice this place is not for you. There's more than Bud, but not a lot. \n\nP.S. Free cookie night is Wednesday.\n\nP.P.S. Get the white chocolate macadamia nut. Who knew french fries came on salads? Pittsburgh did.\n\nSalads are good. Pizza looked tasty. Service is helpful (when you can find it).\n\nThe pepper steak salad is pretty good - get it with ranch. Or instead, just get a plate of those garlic knots. They're the best thing there.\n\nAnd the comment about helpful service - when I went to pay the bill it was too windy for me to leave it out on the table. Instead I went inside and it was a no-man's land. No person working could be found for a good three minutes while I stood there with my bill in hand. I mean, what kind of place is dead empty of all wait staff, bartenders, or any person who worked there for that long during the lunch rush? Seems odd. I don't really have a good review for this place. It's not that the place isn't good it's just that I don't have an accurate experience to recount.\n\nI went for bacon night. This is on Tuesdays.\n\nI saw an outside patio on my way in. On a nice day, that area seems...nice.\n\nBut the happy hour was good. And once the bacon started it kept flowing. So by far this was the best part. \n\nOh, so while I would have usually given this place 3 stars for simply existing and providing me free bacon, I knocked it down due to the really inept barstaff. I spent way too long at the bar before being acknowledged to order a drink.\n\nYeesh.

{"text": "Not a bad choice for a neighborhood pizza place. We live about 1 1/2 miles from here and they won't deliver up Brighton Road, which is kind of an annoyance. The pizza is decent, and I like their sauce. The garlic bread and breadsticks aren't too shabby. The prices are certainly reasonable. Admittedly, I've never tried the subs. And most nights when you call they put you on hold right away because there is only one person answering the phone, and that person seems to be busy cooking as well. But the pizza is leaps and bounds better than Mandy's, which is downright terrible. Not a bad little local pizza spot overall. Way better than your average \"bar\" food. But make no mistake, this place is a great bar. Lots of fun beers on tap, good cocktails, cool atmosphere. You can sit at any of a few high top tables, at the bar, or back in the back of the bar at a few booths. \n\nI've tried a few different appetizers in the few years I've been coming here. Standouts to me were the fried zucchini and the fried cheese wedges. These are somehow are leaps and bounds more delicious than any other fried goodies I've ordered at a bar. I've ordered a few different veggie options of entrees, of which they have a few tasty choices. The veggie burger is amazing, the veggie pita is nice crunchy mix of grilled veggies and asiago (mmm), and my new obsession is the Lot 17 salad, which I had never tried until recently. Wowwwwww. Huge portion, fresh berries, feta, fried leeks (!!!!), and a very fresh raspberry vinaigrette. \n\nDo yourself a favor, order anything. It's ALL good. But don't skip the fries. The regular fries are good. But I have no idea why you'd get those when you could get the cajun fries. They taste like the Andy Capp Hot Fries that you used to be able to get by the bag (I have no idea if you still can, don't really care, these are better). Spicy and crispy and a nice accent to whatever you choose. Not your thing? Then the sweet potato fries should be perfect for you. So. Freaking. Good. And the brown sugar/butter sauce they are served with is like crack. I've tried to duplicate it at home with little success. Worth the trip alone. I'm salivating right now. \n\nThe staff is always friendly and helpful, service is usually great. A few TVs line this place so it's a good place to watch a game. I'd watch anything there if it was served with a side of that sweet potato fry sauce. This has been my go to suggestion when friends want to meet for drinks for years. The atmosphere can't be beat, the outdoor patio is one of the cities best, the drinks are consistent, and the menu is just good fun. The brunch at Harris is really something special, and a frozen mimosa is probably the second coolest thing ever. The first, naturally, is the frozen cosmo, which the Harris Grill has perfected (I get mine with a shot of Chambord...mmmm). They have lots of vegetarian options for me, although they've done away with the falafel wrap recently...what gives? It was a favorite! They make some badass Mac & Cheese, and the portion is huge. Their desserts are worth saving room for. The second floor is my favorite place to sit, feels intimate and kind of dark and cozy.

{"text": "Three stars is super accurate for this place. We decided to do take out from here after walking by it a hundred times after the gym and hearing radio commercials about it from that god forsaken BUBBA SHOW (does that plug raise anyone else's blood pressure??) Our order was ready in 15 minutes (speedy!) and we got a large 1 topping pizza for ~$8 and a side of fries. All together like $13 for three people, which is pretty good. As for the pizza, the crust was crispy and not too thick or thin, and the sauce was sweet, not seasoned. I prefer a more herby sauce myself, so I wasn't wowed by it. The fries were a bit soggy, but tasty. Overall, if I were in a pinch I'd order from here no problem but it's not a place I'd set out to order from because I love it. Don't be put off by the decor in this place- their food is legit! I personally have had their cheese steak, hot Italian, and fries. Their bread is good, their meat is delicious, and their fries are FRESH not frozen. They're made to order, and perfection. Two people can easily share a small fry- the portions are generous. If you've got a hankering for a legitimate hoagie/sub, head to Peppi's. You won't be disappointed. This place is exactly what it should be: good greasy spoon diner food. Bougie foodies with high expectations stay calm! I've only had good food here, and I always leave stuffed and satisfied. The Greek Hobo omelette is my absolute favorite. If you get coffee, the only way to get the most bang for your two plus bucks is to get a few refills while you're there. Other than that, it's pretty much what you'd expect from a diner. We went here tonight for the first time since I was craving a burger and we've been meaning to check this place out. It has a cozy atmosphere: dark, some leather chairs and mis-matchy furniture, candles, a gas fireplace at the door, good music...\n\nWe were told there would be a wait, but we were more than welcome to sit at the bar. We were fine with that. Just after we received our drinks at the bar the hostess came over to ask us if we'd mind sitting in the lounge, a table with couches as seating. We gladly took the table in lieu of waiting 20-30 minutes as we originally planned on. We closed our tab at the bar and were seated in the lounge. The couch was comfy and we were happier with the couch than a standard table and chairs, since we were having a date night and we were away from the other patrons, able to sit next to each other :)\n\nWe had a pretty entertaining time reading through the food menu, and the drink menu. It's written hilariously.\n\nI decided on the I Can Has Bacon Cheezeburgher (the title! gah!) and my date chose the Thanksgiving Burger (the actual comical name escapes me). My cheeseburger was delicious. Piled with delicious bacon and  cheese, and came with pickles, onions, tomato and lettuce. It was wonderful. I've had many a charred to the point of burnt disgusting burgers in this town and this burger was not one of them. I ordered the fries with it, though I was offered a plethora of options, and the fries were delicious. Crispy, salty, delicious. On the other hand, the thanksgiving burger was MUCH too spicy. In the rosemary spice kind of way. Way too much seasoning. His breath was pretty ungodly the rest of the night, and he didn't particularly enjoy it.\n\nAs far as service goes, I specifically want to note that we were well taken care of the whole night. Our waitress as attentive, we never had empty glasses of water or drinks and were not in need of anything. She brought our check when we asked, and it took a few minutes for her to come back to charge our card. Another staff member saw that it hadn't been done yet, came by and took care of it for us without our asking.

{"text": "I am not a fan of this chain's food or this locations service.\n\nHowever!  \n\nSteak n Shake milkshakes totally rock.  Very thick, regular is the perfect size to get me home from the Waterfront. First, this is a big chain - not my favorite type of eatery.  For me, four stars is max for this type of establishment for the simple reason that no one has license to create anything truly unique...\n\nHowever!  The Chilean Sea Bass Marinated in Oolong Tea is freakin' fantastic!  10+\n\nNow - everyone was happy with their meals and let me tell you it was a ridiculously busy night, servers were threading their way through patrons waiting to be seated and our service was very good.\n\nI've been to PFC Vegas and PFC NYC - our Homestead PFC definitely beats them both.  So many great little places to try in the 'Burgh, but I wouldn't resist going back to this particular PFC. Ok, Yelpers, I've been relying on you for a couple of years, but...  \n\nHad a lovely meal at Christo's last night.  Someone I work with frequents and recommended.  Then I turned to the Yelp community for confirmation and was torn because of the number of seemingly dissatisfied reviews.  I decided to risk one meal (after all, how much of a risk is THAT, really??) and follow the co-worker's referral.\n\nWe started with the house-made wine.  Red for Friend and sweet white for me.  Served in a juice glass and yummy enough for both of us to order another.\nHummus.  Not bland at all.  Freshly made and pleasingly lemony.  Pita was soft and fresh, as well.\n\nGreek salad.  Iceberg / Romaine mix with olives, green onions, and bit of marinated sweet red pepper.  Anchovies if you want 'em - and I always do!  Nice sized and great tasting. I cannot comment on the dressing as I abstained (anchovies do the trick for me).\n\nThe meatball dish was had by Friend and the lamb kabob for me.  Both dishes came with rice and stewed veggies.  We cleaned our plates and thoroughly enjoyed our meals.\n\nThe seating area is old.  The d\u00e9cor is old.  The pictures on the wall are authentic and include images of the owner as a child and through his life.  This is not a typical city restaurant and is certainly not competing with Alihan's, next door, or any of the other white linen establishments.  There is no input from 'corporate' and I counted four men working, total.\n\nThis is a come-as-you-are-and-I'll-sell-you-good-food kinda spot.  And that's what we did.  And that's what they did.  Sometimes it's just that simple. We went to Lidia's on a \"tasting Groupon\"\n\nFor two:  Bottle of wine (many choices), caesar salad, endless pasta trio and a small tiramisu\n\nThe service was in the right place at the right time, but the leader (there is a service team) was clearly operating by rote and extremely disengaged with his food-service-is-how-I-pay-my-bills situation.  \n\nAnyway - the trio consisted of three very different pastas which are apparently are frequently changed up.\n\nI loved our Groupon intro and would not hesitate to go back for a wider menu experience Sunday night, one week after the Steelers were officially \"out\".  The restaurant was not crowded.  There were (2) 20-somethings and (2) 50-somethings which turned into (2) Burgers (1) Pulled Pork and (1) Angus Salad.  \n\nEverything was done perfectly.  Calamari was spicy, tender and fantastic.\n\nService was good and everyone was friendly.  Almost too dark to enjoy the meal, but ok.  We all agreed that we'd like to go back and try out a few other menu items.  Especially in the summer, to try out the patio!", "user_id": "nYKao-8w_IOj4Mv8QWb2vg", "business_id": "6ilJq_05xRgek_8qUp36-g"}
{"text": "I unapologetically love Tasty Chinese. Aside from the slightly higher bar of quality that their food provides, I've found comfort in never ordering a dish I didn't like. The friendly staff, clean tables, and stellar turnaround time on orders has made Tasty my go-to in terms of East End Chinese orders for pick-up.\n\nMy usual order for three people includes crab rangoon or egg rolls, hot and sour soup, General Tso's chicken, fried rice, and lo mein. I encourage you to order whatever you want, though, because it's all pretty...pretty...pretty Tasty. Cafe Zinho is a quaint and romantic Portuguese-American restaurant. While they may not take the progressive-dish risks of the similarly-priced contemporary cuisine options in the area, they still manage to put their own twist on classic dishes--and they do it well.\n\nI wish I could pinpoint a dish to recommend, but everything I tasted left me more satisfied than the previous bite. The smaller seating area allows for an intimate dinner whether you're coming as a couple or bringing the whole family. Bring your own bottle, follow your gut (or the waiter's recommendations), and sink in to Cafe Zinho. The worst part? When it's all over, you have to leave. Lot 17 is the perfect neighborhood spot for any way you might be feeling. Trust me, I've felt all types of ways going to Lot 17. Be it a few drinks before getting rowdy, watching a game, a few drinks after getting rowdy, a nice place to relax, dinner with friends, dinner with family, dinner alone, jonesing for ribs, drinking alone, just-got-fired-need-a-bourbon, just-got-hired-need-a-Yuengling, just-got-promoted-shots-all-around...whatever atmosphere you're looking for, chances are Lot 17 can help you out.\n\nThe staff is friendly and casual (sometimes negligent but they're generally nice about everything), the cooks provide a nice twist on casual barfood (they have healthy options and daily specials), the drinks are cheap, the rotating draft list is spot-on, the pours are generous, and they have booths in the back. What more could you ask for?\n\nTry the ribs. No, the mac and cheese. No, try the chicken sandwiches. No, wait, try the coconut crusted chicken fingers. I can't stress how incredible the Big Burrito group is. They deserve prizes.\n\nI came to Soba with two friends for the Oc Om Boc festival, and was pleased to order and eat the price-fixed ($35) four-course meal they offered. Delicious pho, egg rolls, spring rolls, duck confit, duck breast, noodles, beef and rice, fresh vegetables, and an incredible dessert of cake with a hint of banana (and a vanilla wafer).\n\nThe lights were turned low, there was a wall with running water streaming down from the top, and there was some contemporary playlist in the background playing all of your NPR favorites (David Gray, Radiohead). As an added bonus, the paper towels in the bathroom were EXCELLENT--I felt so guilty wiping my hands on them and throwing them away.\n\nThe menu is a bit pricey, but I don't think I'm experienced enough to judge its price vs. the food...I'm just a pretty broke college student who spends all of his expendable income on nice places like Soba. Harris Grill is 100% OK. The service is nice, the drink list is nice, the menu (albeit confusing) is nice, and my overall experience has been...err...nice.\n\nEverything is a little expensive, and I don't really understand the menu (are they joking in some places? Is it supposed to be serious? Why is everything priced awkwardly?), but they have a solid brew list and the outdoor seating is crucial.\n\nTake a date here, take a group here, or come on a Sunday morning for their brunch (which is also nice).", "user_id": "-0itF0VWVBe3k2AdfUReGA", "business_id": "Y2p07YEC8xOsYTHWf0UxiA"}
{"text": "D's is a typical bar food type of place.  It's size makes it cozy and in general it has a nice, happy ambience.  The food is nothing spectacular but not bad as well - even though the hot dogs are pretty good.  It has a large selection of drafts and there is also a back \"room\" where you can buy pretty much any beer that exists either for taking it to your home or for having it with your dinner.  The service was fast and helpful.  I am sure I will be visiting this place again in the future but just do not expect something spectacular. This is a really nice place to hang out during the summer and while the weather is good.  Coming from a sunny country, with lots of coastline and having lived for many years in California as well, this place gives to me \"some\" of the same feel.  \n\nHowever, having said that, the restaurant itself it is extremely purely run.  The service seems to be in a hurry (even when there are not many people really in the place).  The menu has different details from what the chef is preparing (e.g., one item we order was supposed to come with potato salad based on the menu but it came with fries).  We also heard people at the nearby tables complaining about their orders being mixed up.  \n\nWith respect to the food it is nothing spectacular, but it is not bad as well.  I would definitely like to try more things on their menu.  I will certainly give it a try during the summer time for sure, but I think the owner needs to re-consider the management of this location because it could really be a gold mine! Tessaro's is one of the first places I ate in Pittsburgh after a full day of stressful interviews and it really made it right! Of course, I have visited the place several times since I moved in Pittsburgh, since the burgers here are phenomenal.  Are they the best in Pittsburgh? I am not sure since there is a lot of competition that appeared since I came, but for sure it is a unique experience.  The place itself has a nice old-style atmosphere that I am a fan of, and this plays its role as well.  Service is also nice and fast every time I have been there.  All in all I highly recommend Tessaro's and be sure I will be going back! Before commenting on the food for this place I have to state that I am not the biggest fun of Asian cuisine.  I was found over there accidentally, since my friends wanted to go there.  Despite this fact I found it interesting place.  The food was well cooked and tasty.  Service was fast and in general a nice, warm atmosphere.  For the record, my company that is into Asian food, love this place (so I assume it is a nice place for whoever likes eastern cuisine). Nice place, towards the expensive side, but the food is great.  Nice atmosphere and it is fairly big.  We went on a Friday night and we were sitted immediately.  The service is fast and nice.  Definitely one of the places that I will visit again. I have been here many many times and overall my experience is very good.  They have a good selection of drinks and decent food.  They mac-n-cheese dishes are delicious and so are their burgers (my favorite used to be their sliders but unfortunately they removed them from their recent menu). The ambiance is also great for both winter and summer (they have outdoor patios), while the service has always been friendly and useful.  I am sure I will be visiting Harris Grill quiet a few more times in the future! A good choice if you find yourself on Elseworth or Shadyside in general.", "user_id": "Hr9I9Jdy3MKCZ7c-bpehMQ", "business_id": "2X5G4Ujq0s4Wfn4TC7gX0g"}
{"text": "I love Tazza D'oro! It is in such a great little area and is a nice place to spend some time with a delicious cup of coffee.\n\nIt it sometimes busy and hard to find a table (which is not surprising since it's a great spot), but I like the neighborhood feel and the staff has always been very friendly.\n\nI usually get iced Americanos in the summer and regular coffee or lattes in the cooler weather. All of the drinks I have ever had here have been tasty. I have also had some of the pastries (and maybe a bagel at some point?) and everything has been fresh.\n\nI'm a big lover of coffee shops and this place fits all of my requirements. While I don't live in Highland Park, it's definitely worth an occasional trip. \"Meh\" is kind of how I felt about this place, which I realize is an opinion that seems to go against the grain. I had heard about D's time and time again. Everyone talked about it like it was the greatest place in existence. I had such high expectations! \n\nI suppose maybe I was expecting too much, which led to some disappointment. A few friends and I went here on a Friday night and it was (predictably) packed. We were fairly lucky to get a table almost right away. \n\nI obviously had to acknowledge that the beer selection is impressive. If you can't find it here, you probably can't find it anywhere in Pittsburgh. I had to check out the famous \"Beer Cave\" which seemed to have just about everything. I think I'll make it a point to pick up some brews here next time I'm looking for something unusual or new.\n\nI wish I had more to say, but I just wasn't feeling it. My friends love it so I'm sure I'll be back, and next time I'll make it a point to try the food. Judging by some of the other reviews, that might change my perception of the place. How have I NOT reviewed Harris Grill yet!?\n\nI am embarrassed to admit how many times I have been here. Actually, I probably couldn't even figure it out if I tried.\n\nThis is a top happy hour spot amongst my friends. You just can't beat the $3 frozen cosmo deal. I can't say I'm usually a fan of bright pink slushy drinks, but a post-work frozen cosmo (or three) on the patio on a warm day? Yes, please. \n\nThat being said, we come here a lot in the warmer months as there is always outdoor seating availability. The inside isn't bad either but you have to take advantage of the nice weather when you can! \n\nAs far as food, Harris has a selection of 1/2 price apps during happy hour--a good option to soak up some of those cosmos. I've had a number of entree items as well, my favorite being the \"Imagine the Rastabilities\" (spicy Jamaican jerk pulled chicken mac and cheese). I'm also a fan of the jerk-style tacos and the (oh so classic) Pittsburgh salad. I can't think of anything from here that I haven't enjoyed.\n\nService isn't terrible, but not the best. We've had mixed experiences. Some of the waiters and waitresses are extremely attentive and friendly, and others not so much. One time it took nearly an hour to get our checks. We actually had to send a member of our party into the restaurant to find someone who could print the checks for us. Right before we left, a manager was coming around to check on tables, and we expressed our frustration to her. She was wonderful about the situation and gave us vouchers for a free entree on our next visit. As a frequent visitor, I really appreciated that she was receptive to our concerns and didn't try to make excuses. I very rarely complain but there was no reason for this kind of hold-up.\n\nOverall, one of the best Shadyside happy hour spots. I'm already looking forward to spring so that I can sip some cosmos and unwind outside!", "user_id": "4tzuxIVry4xkOR9vbpgjrw", "business_id": "83_p9vIqOq1TUIf3_GD7bA"}
{"text": "I went to olive or twist after my graduation, so we arrived somewhat late in the evening.  As the name suggests, they are known for their martinis.  With about 2 dozen on the menu, it was hard to choose which one to get, but I went with el jardin and then the dark knight.  Both were delicious (and actually my first two martinis).  We all passed around our martinis and each one was better than the last.\n\nFor food, we started with the nachos and calamari.  The nachos were nothing to write home about (pun intended), but the calamari was more than just fried.  It had a sweet glaze on it that tasted almost like maple syrup, but not that sweet.  Really delicious and an interesting take on an appetizer that is usually just fried and served.\n\nFor the entr\u00e9e, I got the delmonico steak.  It was tasty, but not hot when it was served.  In fact, my grandfather got the same thing and he asked them to heat his up and it came back exactly the same.  The server was very polite and made it clear that he told the chef to heat it up, but i don't how on earth a chef can get that feedback and send out the same exact thing.  After a second time of asking to heat it up, it finally was hot when served.\n\nAll in all it was an interesting restaurant and definitely a good place for a drink or two if your downtown in the area. Went to Harris Grill last night for my last night in Pittsburgh.  Really cool experience and it was a beautiful night to sit outside and enjoy the atmosphere.\n\nFirst, Tuesday is bacon night and I'm not quite sure how it works, but I heard it's free bacon at the bar and $1 baskets of bacon if you're sitting at a table.  My friends and I had a drink and some bacon at the bar while we waited for a table (obviously bacon night is a hit and makes the restaurant busy).  I really enjoyed the selection of beers.  I wanted to try the Game of Thrones beer, but liked the amber beer they had too much to switch.\n\nAs an app, we shared the buffalo chicken dip.  It was not the biggest portion, but it's always nice eating grilled pita instead of just tortilla chips every so often.  The dip had very large pieces of chicken and was crusted with blue cheese.  Pretty basic and well executed.\n\nThe menu is pretty simple, but difficult to read.  My friends had been there before so they knew what to look for, but I had a difficult time reading through the commentary and trying to tell what was in each dish.  One of my friends recommended something he had gotten before, so I decided that was easier than wasting my time with the menu.\n\nI got the mac and cheese and added in lobster and bacon.  It was really decadent and better than I expected.  The cheese was very creamy and flow-y.  A lot of times, the cheese on mac and cheese doesn't flow well, but I really liked the consistency of Harris Grill's mac and cheese.  The lobster was also very delicious.  As for the bacon, they just put it on top.  So basically it was lobster mac and cheese with some bacon strips on top.  I was expecting either bacon bits mixed with everything or even bacon strips submerged in the cheese.  Nonetheless, the bacon was very crispy and i dipped a few strips in the cheese which was a solid idea.", "user_id": "JlnjRsBhCV7BKGtK41PKDg", "business_id": "OxIeMVcop5oxBUWANi-1Rw"}
{"text": "Fast delivery! Food was still warm when it arrived, which is always a plus when ordering delivery. \nI got the special - Large pizza & a dozen wings.\nI paid the $2.29 extra for a pepperoni topping. Fair amount of cheese & pepperoni on the entire pizza. Crust isn't too crunchy, nor too soft.\nI got the garlic parm and buffalo sauce ($1 each) for my wings - they put all the wings in garlic parm and gave me a side of buffalo sauce. I'm not sure how that made sense. Also, no ranch or dipping sauce even though it was requested. \n\n\nOverall, an okay to decent pizza place that delivers. *$1 delivery fee* Decent Italian food for a chain restaurant. I've been to the one in Tampa, FL and I thought this one was very similar. \nI love the bread they serve before dinner (probably due to the yummy garlic butter they serve with it). \nThe tossed salads they serve prior to lose entrees are relatively comparable to other tossed salads from elsewhere. The Italian and ranch dressings were both good. \nWe ordered the Italian feast for two (right under $27), and we had leftovers for almost 3 meals. The chicken parm is only good when still hot, otherwise the chicken tastes frozen. The spaghetti is plain. The lasagna is their popular dish and I would have to agree with the masses. The sausage is a sweet sausage and plain. The cheese filled ravioli over Alfredo was surprisingly pretty good. \nThe warehouse was a good choice for what was offered, though for \"authentic\" Italian, I will have to go elsewhere. A cute, cozy restaurant you don't expect to find if you're in the area. \nThe service was not enthusiastic & short with words, though she got the job done. \nWe started off with the she crab soup and French onion soup. Of the two, the she crab was my favorite. It had chunks and was not overly sweet (like some seafood soups tend to be). The French onion was decent, though had too many onions. I did like that the bread that came in it was a bit crispy, which was an unusual, but pleasant surprise. \nThe meals came with salads, we ordered the Amel salads. The dressing was interesting. Enjoyable enough. \nThe steak tips and mushrooms - I feel like they could've been better if she asked me what temperature I wanted the steak cooked. I like my steak more on the medium rare side and it was more on the medium well, very close to well done side. The sauce was different and yummy. I think the mushrooms helped. The veggies and mashed potatoes were both tasty!\nThe lamb shank - the lamb fell right off the bone. Very juicy and flavorful. My friend was in food heaven. Service was mediocre at best. I was a one person party, so I sat at the sushi bar which was actually very interesting - watching the sushi makers prepare all the different sushi orders. \nI ordered the first date roll. Overall, a good mix of spicy and not. The ingredients tasted fresh. \nI might go back if I'm in the area, but nothing to go out of my way for. We tried delivery - something different other than the usual pizza, Chinese or Thai food offerings around the area.\nThe delmonico a go-go steak sandwich was pretty good! There was a little less meat, and a little too much bread, but overall, flavorful and well balanced with the different ingredients. I did a side of mac&cheese for a little uncharge. *Delicious! I would definitely recommend it. Next time, I am trying a mac&cheese with chicken or seafood. Something fun.\nThe tater tot appetizer (with gravy and cheese curds) was a unique twist on regular tater tots. The gravy was yummy, and melted cheese is always a win! The tater tots were crispy.\nThe spinach dip was not a win for me. My friend loved it; however, I had one pita bread chip with a scoop, and that was more than enough. It tasted way too much like spinach (and not in a good way). \nMy friend ordered the For carnitas, you can't beat us sandwich. He loved it. I had a bite, and must admit that the sandwich was tender and had some flavor. He ordered the chili as his side, and said that was some of the best vegetarian chili he's had before (he ate the whole thing in 6 bites).", "user_id": "v_0YeVcYle6cWKrfn0vpXA", "business_id": "lHP5STO7aomlEQixH8m1aA"}
{"text": "Luigi's pizza is amazing! The sicilian pizza takes me back to how my grandma used to make homemade pizza. I can't wait to go back - definitely worth the 45-minute trip there :) I have been to Atria locations around the city - but this was my first time at the Atria's location at PNC Park on the North Shore of Pittsburgh. My young professional group had an event there last night, so it was a good chance to check it out. Our event was held upstairs, and since we had a small group, they wouldn't guarantee the private room downstairs. It worked for the most part, but those of us that sat in the back had trouble hearing the speakers, and the lights were dim. The noise from the diners downstairs plus the house music carried through and at times it was very loud and hard to hear. I would say that it's a good place for a group dinner, but not for a speaking event. I can't comment on food/drink as I didn't have any. The atmosphere is nice BUT I wasn't too impressed with the layout of the whole place. Didn't see to have a good flow to it. Also, the bathrooms upstairs where our event was were out of order, so everyone had to go downstairs to use the restrooms. SoHo is always a great place to start out at before heading to a Pirates game, or anything else going on in the North Shore. My networking group had a social here a couple of weeks ago - and it went awesome! We provided appetizers for the group - and they ended up bringing more than what we had ordered as a thank you. Also, we had almost 100 people They sectioned off part of the bar for our group, and were able to accommodate everyone with their drink orders in a quick fashion. They are SUPER easy to work with, and we are looking to hold more repeat events here because of that. Last night was the first time I went to Soba and I LOVED it! My friends and I got some tables in the lounge area and it was the perfect setting for a quiet Saturday night catching up with friends. The whole place has such a great vibe, the service was awesome, and the drinks were dee-lish! I can't wait to go back and have dinner there. This was my first time at the Elbow Room at their new location on Walnut Street (previously located on Ellsworth Avenue.) My friend and I met for a low key Friday night dinner, but when we arrived at 6:30pm, to our surprise - it was PACKED!! It was really nice to see it so lively and bustling with a ton of people. It was a 30 minute wait for a table, and in that time we grabbed a drink at that bar. By the time we did that, our table was ready. After we ordered, our appetizer, salads, and entrees were all out within 15-20 minutes. The service was amazing, from our waitress, to even the owner coming out to make sure everything was ok. We ordered the fried zucchini for an appetizer, which was good but I thought the breading as a little bland, a great side salad, and I had the mediterranean pasta for my entree. Everything was better than I had expected it to be and I will definitely be returning for happy hour and dinner, hopefully very soon! 2 thumbs up! Well, my update has half of my original rating. Not because of their food, but because of the service. My friend booked her birthday party there this past Saturday night in their tavern room. When we got there, the room that was supposed to be set up for her party and guests was completely full of other restaurant patrons. She had called in advance to confirm party details and they assured her that everything would be fine. Not the case when we got there. The person she set the party up with wasn't working that night, and it took the hostess 15 minutes to find his \"note\" that was left about the party. It took another hour for them to clear somewhat of an area for the party, which was now squeezed into the bar area. The whole area never fully got cleared out for her party, and we had to share space with people who they had sat in that hour that we had waited for it to clear out. They also put only one server on staff, which was insanity and chaos because there were 30 of us at this party. I think she got 1 out of every 4 drink orders correct. I would still go here to eat for dinner, but I would never recommend it to anyone looking to have a party or event here.", "user_id": "iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ", "business_id": "eOv0Dbq2E8sd0CKMAqTImw"}

Thankfully that's when me and my gang decided to check out this little lovely! \n\nBrunch menu has both traditional brunch fair and some Italian twists. My mum had Challah French toast and loved it. Pops had their breakfast risotto with a fried egg on top - I tried that and it had a nice kick to it.\n\nOther folks at the table had the eggs Benedict, salad, and Sammy. Over all everyone was happy and it was only half full so easy to talk and hang out. \n\nAnd for the music complainer (you whining stinker) we had a nice iPod mix on when we were there! Want a taste of the old ethnic communities of Pittsburgh? Go to Max's Allegheny Tavern. German never tasted sooo nice!\n\nMenu Fav: Potato Pancake Reuben. Forget the bread and wrap your lips around sweet potato pancakes and loads of corned beef. Try the hot potato salad too. Mr. Obama you haven't had breakfast in Pittsburgh until you've gone to JoJo's! (Pamela's has nothing on this tasty dive!)\nDon't let the humble literal hole in the wall decor scare you! Taste the best The Strip District has to offer in produce, meats and bread.

Large and in charge this more than breakfast portion will leave you full and happy. Now if you care about your cholesterol make this a once in awhile place but if you live for bacon, sausage and all things breakfast make a point to go to JoJo's all the time! Lidia's is a nice place for a special occasion but misses the mark for this foodie. Their Octopus Appetizer is perfect however their pasta sampler was disappointing. One of the selections was not cooked and clumped together a silly mistake from the kitchen that shamed the attentive wait staff. Dessert was no better. My vanilla creme sauce looked like snot next to a melted mess of ice cream. Take a non foodie friend here to be nice but not for a culinary fun find. Great Pho. Go here for fresh soul warming food with unique flavor. ANOTHER GOOD EATERY FROM THE BIG BURRITO GROUP.\n\nWe went to celebrate my bros girlfriends b-day. BECAUSE if you sign up for the big burrito birthday club you get a yearly $30 birthday voucher for most of the big burrito restaurants!!! \nAny who...this place has a high end warm feeling. Menu had alot to choose from in the way of Asian fusion. We tried the calamari which was good. Chopped salad was refreshing but not everyone at the table liked it. I had scallops - large and well cooked. Dessert was show only. The cashew terrine was so so. I would love to try more of the small plates. I felt the entire place was good enough to visit again.

She profusely apologized and then the manager came over and apologized as well. They both asked if my hubby wanted anything else but he was too weirded out to eat anything else. Then the manager comped the whole meal as a mea culpa (yea Latin!).

{"text": "Decided to grab a drink and a quick dinner with my ball n' chain at the bar.  I ordered the half n' half combo of soup and sandwich (grilled cheese and tomato soup).  The Husband had the grilled chicken sammie.  As soon as the kitchen dumped out my order the bartender immediately took issue with the portion size.  It was much appreciated.  He immediately went back and got me more food.  Regardless of how good the service, the food was not worth coming for.  The soup was the consistency of the stuff in the canned soup that they instruct you to add water to prior to heating (minus the whole adding water step).  As a result, it was as thick as a dip.  Despite not being soup, it made a great dip for the potato chips.  Sit at the bar. Don't bust out the pitchforks but I may have committed the ultimate faux pas in Pittsburgh history.  I went into Primantis and ordered the spaghetti.  \"Wait, what?!\" you say.  Let me explain.\n\nI was a young and innocent city transplant and was taken to Primantis by a very insistent local.  I noticed a chalkboard sign for spaghetti while trying to deciper the menu.  Sold.  I walk up to the counter, and with a shamefully straight face, place my order.  Crickets.  I guess I appeared so adamant that they actually brought out some chefboyardee in a styrofoam bowl.  \n\nI slid into the booth and happily munched on my canned noodles while my date buried his head in his hands.\n\nThe noodles are top notch but I hear the sandwichs are even better. I have been craving pizza for days so for lunch I grabbed 2 slices and a side salad in an effort to balance my poor decision.  The pizza was greasy and good. The side salad was a handful of lettuce, raw onion, 2 slice tomato and about 2 cups of shredded cheese. So much for healthy.... I tend to forget / decide my hot mess morning look takes precedent to eating breakfast prior to leaving for work.  Smallman is within walking distance of my office so that's a win.  \n\nA few times I've walked in around 10:40 and asked for an egg sandwich.  The woman behind the counter gets a really serious look on her face and states they stop serving breakfast at 10:30. Mind you the place is empty. (It gets packed round noonish).  \n\nShe then slowly turns around and with great flair asks the guy slicing meat if he is okay with cooking an egg.  He is fine with it and doesn't give two sh$ts.  She,however, is a stickler for breakfast rules.  Much respect.  Order your eggs before 10:30.\n\nLunch options are consistently good albeit a little pricey. Best gem in Shadyside. The drinks! The food! All consistently great. Servers are friendly and very funny. Always leave with a smile on my face, full belly, and often a bit buzzed and anticipating spending the remainder of my day vegging on the couch napping and half watching food network. As we strolled up Walnut Street this morning we were greeted by a large sandwich board sign advertising brunch.  Spirits lifted we raced inside for the sidewalk advertised  breakfast glories...sat down...and were told brunch was only on Sundays. My lil heart fell. \nRegroup. I ordered the half sandwich and chili and my partner in this mess ordered a chop salad.  \nThe chili should be renamed Alpo & Cheddar. The salads are better at Get Go.\nAnd direct quote upon our server checking on us..drumroll....\"From what I see I presume you are okay\" and a quick exit stage left.\nWe shall not be returning. Even as tempting as the $10 sangria made of pure canned fruit juice appears.", "user_id": "qbzoEU-SPiGrmO41giYrcQ", "business_id": "Ts4xsKPU7FNPPZRj-nRjIg"}
{"text": "Pros: Vegan food in Pittsburgh?  YES!  great music, friendly accommodating service, huge variety of drinks, fabulous decor\n\nCons: Not a convenient location for the car-less me, but well that's just me\n\nHi, I am a non-drinker and rarely have I found an establishment with an extensive list of non-alcoholic drinks.  Granted, Quiet Storm like many Pittsburgh places doesn't have an alcohol license and has to make do.  Ginger lemonade?  Yes.  All these other things from the soda fountain that are adult like enough for me?  Yeah!\n\nI do love my meat, but found the vegan food here pretty good (albeit dry but I attribute that to my love of meaty things).  They used to have a prixe fixe meal on the weekends, but I think they got rid of that due to a low turnout.  Too bad most of Pittsburgh doesn't really learn to love culture.\n\nUsually good music acts here.  Although the few times I was here, there was barely anybody else there besides the group I dragged along and the band's friends.  Usually 2-3 acts play.  Live.  And it's nice that there aren't many of us because we can sit up close.  And be sure to kick the friend who thinks it's ok to talk over the music.  \n\nThe bathroom also has a decor to match the style of the coffeehouse.\n\nI have never been here during the daytime so I can't comment on that.  Always great service when we came here for dinner and the music (since we were basically the only ones there).  Sometimes a minimal cover for the music.  There are books and comfy couches for the daytime coffee drinkers. Cafe Zinho was on my list of things to do before leaving Pittsburgh.  But who knew it was closed for lunch in May?\n\nI eventually came here with my parents (who are not accustomed to non-Chinese establishments).  Arriving at 5:30 pm, we still were able to get a table without any prior reservation.  The host was the owner of the restaurant and gave a personal touch to the service.\n\nThe decor and environment gave Cafe Zinho a nice off-the-beaten path look.  Gypsy and bohemian.\n\nFood was superb.  I had the quail, but wasn't given the appropriate utensils to eat it.  My mom loved the lamb.  And of course, the dessert was fabulous.  Since the kitchen is right now nearby, you can see the cooks making your meal or dessert.\n\nThis place only accepts cash although there's an atm nearby.  My mom had a fit because when they bill came they had rounded up with a difference of less than a dollar.  I would give this place 4.5 stars, but I rounded up. People who know me...know me as a food fanatic.  Tessaro's is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh, hands down.  It is not pricey.  It is not pretentious.  It is all-American and good food.\n\nEverything about it is so...customer-centric that recalls the essence of Pittsburgh.  The host (normally the owner - check out his fantastic Heinz bottle tie that he wears every Friday) takes the number in your party and actually remembers your face.\n\nPeople come here normally for the burgers.  The patty is incredibly juicy (they ground it in the restaurant, not delivered, very fresh and you can taste it).  The lettuce crisp.  Tomatoes no exception.  I can't comment on cheeseburgers since I don't like cheese in them.  I have been here for Thursday Ribs night and it's absolutely fantastic, particularly the chicken ribs.\n\nGets very crowded during the dinner rush hour so expect to wait between 6-8 pm. Pros: convenient location in Shadyside, sufficient lighting for the mood\n\nCons: Crowded, full of frat-boy types, bartenders would kick everyone out at closing time\n\nPerhaps, I didn't have a great experience because I got dragged here against my will.\n\nBut it was unbearably crowded and loud.  The kind where it's most likely that you'll spill someone's else's drink.  It was more than once that I heard glass breaking.  It's a kind of place you would go to meet random people than a place you would go to just hang out with friends. \n\nMy friends enjoyed their drinks, so I grant the bar that.  At closing time however, the bartender yelled that we had to get out since it was closing.  They turned on the bright lights, cut the music and stopped the heat to force us out.\n\nSo I might not be the target audience.  This is my friend's favorite bar.  I am not sure why.  The frat-boy like atmosphere may be it, but I have always preferred the low-key type bars.", "user_id": "zQnP80zi4Fe4AOV4MtpMkQ", "business_id": "PzG0XmAmtXFs6Fdnubf41g"}
{"text": "I've been told several times that this place had a great brunch.  Upon arrival, the menu was very limited and the service was abysmal despite a nearly empty restaurant.  We literally waited 15 mins. at our table and then left prior to ordering. This is probably my favorite bar in Pittsburgh.  The pizza is solid, the hot dogs are great, and the beer cave...mmmm.  My only complaint is that they haven't opened another one on the other side of town! Average food, slightly above average prices for the quality/taste, average price for the location, lack-luster service.\n\nThis place (the location, the actual building itself, etc.) could be so much more.  I wish they would either step it up, or sell the business to someone that would let it achieve its true potential.\n\nUntil then, there are other dining options in Regent Square and they should be explored. OVERHYPED.  I've had better burgers almost everywhere. With the not-so-recent closing of Sweet Basil still looming in my mind, I have yet to find a new thai food home.  I headed to Thai Cuisine with high hopes and several positive reviews from friends.\n\nThe service was good, decor so-so, and prices were great.  In fact, I double-checked the bill because I thought the waitress may have forgotten to add an entree, it was that reasonably priced!  \n\nThe food was good, solid thai food.  My mind wasn't blown, nor was I disappointed.  I think all thai restaurants need to unite and decide on a single \"heat scale\" to rule them all.  Some places it's 1-5, some 1-10, and I've even seen a 1-7 thrown in here and there.  The problem is, they are all subjective to the cook.\n\nI ordered a 7 out of 10 and got back something milder than mild buffalo wing hot.  I think I ruined the food a little by adding my own mix of chilis.  My wife loved her curry, and my pad thai wasn't bad.  I'd go back, but the search continues... I've had many great experience at Soba, but our most recent visit didn't quite match the rest.\n\nThe service was great, as usual, but we had a few misses with the food.\n\nWe started off with the spicy pork lettuce wraps, which were delicious last time!  This time, soooo salty.  Omg.  It was as if someone had spilled salt into the bowl.  Granted, it wasn't enough to be completely inedible, but it did sort of ruin the dish.\n\nFor the main course, I had my usual Bi Bim Bap and my wife had her usual tuna.  Her tuna was done perfectly.  They seem to have this nailed.  My bi bim bap was hot, but lacked any of the crispy, slightly dry rice around the outsides of the bowl.  It was all just regular-old, glutinous, freshly steamed rice.  For bi bim bap lovers, you know that the little added crunch and texture of that crusty rice really makes the dish!\n\nWe had an early reservation so we could make an early show.  My guess is that the kitchen hadn't quite \"gotten up to speed\" for the dinner rush yet.  Oh well.  I would still whole-heartedly recommend Soba, but this time was a miss. Food is mediocre but the wing specials and flavors are decent.\n\nThe beer specials are pretty good.  It has a dive bar feel despite being in the heart of Shadyside, which is a nice change of pace if that's what you are looking for.  The TV situation for sports isn't the best, but there are quite a few TV's and you should be able to catch the game from wherever you are seated.\n\nThe outdoor patio/bar is a nice touch in Summer.", "user_id": "TbUzjXVKCWTEW1W56Ayiyg", "business_id": "ZL6DNzyenFm9Kpz6uADlNg"}
{"text": "Wing night wednesdays! 50 cent price wings and $1 beer at William Penn on Tuesdays and my body is not hurting too badly the next day, Buffalo Blues for all you can eat wings. There are a ton of sauces to pair with these wings. They bring them out 5 at a time so plan on ordering your next selection when your wings come out because they take quite a bit of time to come. I don't think I have ever eaten the other food here except for the wings because they are pretty good. The only downside to this place is that service is really really slow. D's has the best Chicago style hot dog in Pittsburgh. Whenever I come here, I usually get 2 of their Chicago dogs and a couple orders of chili fries when I'm with a bunch of people. The best part of D's is their beer cave. It is packed with beers all over the world. This was the only place I could find Perkuno's Hammer before it got retired. You can find bottles of literally anything here. The best part is that you can grab a 6-pack and just fit any 6 beers in it to go or have them for the table. Morton's gets a 4 star because they are more expensive than Peter Luger's and not as good as Peter Lugers.\n\nHowever, Morton's is a very good chain steakhouse. I'd suggest going with a group of people so then you can order the porterhouse for 2. It is delicious. They bring it out on a hot place and set it between the 2 people eating it. You are then each given a piping hot plate with hot butter drizzled on it. The server then puts some of the meat on your plate and rubs it around in the butter. Delicious. For the sides, I would suggest getting the creamed spinach. The asparagus isn't bad either. \n\nI actually went there for my fraternity senior class dinner with a group of 8 guys and they gave us our own room which was really cool. You just have to put down a cover for each person which you lose if one guy doesn't show up. We all got the porterhouse for 2. \n\nFor deserts, you need to get the souffle which has to be ordered with the meal because it takes some time to make.\n\nAfter multiple bottles of $60-80 wines, the total tab came out to a little more than $1000 for the table which wasn't too bad. Great place to go at 3 am when your hammered and just want some food. Ritters only takes cash and the service can be extremely terrible sometimes. However, they are open 24 hours and will serve you breakfast. I think they've seen enough of their share of drunken idiots like us that they're used to it by now. Oh. Did I mention that they are open 24 hours. AWESOME! Tuesday nights and I believe Saturday are 25 cent wings and dollar drafts. My friends and I hit this place up nearly every Tuesday when we were still in college. The crowd is mostly college kids due to its proximity to Carnegie Mellon.\n\nThe kitchen sink wings are the best wings I have ever eaten in my life. They are made a little different each time. Sometimes they are nice and spicy, sometimes not so spicy. If you manage to get them spicy. savor the flavor. They are also really good when they aren't that hot but even better when they are nice and spicy. The waitresses are really nice and once you go there enough times, they just start bringing over trays of beer when it looks like you are getting low.  The chili cheese fries are also slathered with chili and cheese and are great if you just want to let loose and not worry about going to the bathroom multiple times the next morning. \n\nActually, if pair the kitchen sink wings with the chili cheese fries, do plan on spending a little more time in the bathroom the next morning. I know I have. Multiple times. When the weather is nice, they open up the back porch so try and grab a table because pounding beers, eating wings and watching footbal couldn't be any better.

{"text": "How have I not reviewed D's yet?? I moved away from Pittsburgh over 5 years ago and EVERY time I come to town, I go to D's. I can't stay away from the awesomeness that is the large walk in fridge of specialty bottled beers or the take away section in the back where you can grab all kinds of good beers you want. Oh and they have a little quick chiller for the warm beers you grab in the back so you can drink them right away :-)\n\nThe food! Ok, I love the veggie dogs on the bun just plain, but I've been rockin' some of the specialty ones lately. I highly recommend the Chihuahua with jalapenos and avocado, or the Mac n' cheese, with...well, mac and cheese. The housemade root beer is also divine. It's perfectly sweet and refreshing. \n\nThis isn't diet food people! There are far too many (oh so lovely) temptations at D's. Splurge and get the cheese fries to share. A small is good for 2 or 3 people and perfect with hotdogs.\n\nOnce you get a table, sit back, relax and enjoy the goods.You won't regret it.  D's is definitely not a rush-in, rush-out sort of place. Iiiiii don't get the appeal. While I liked my sandwich and the service was very quick and pretty good, it wasn't really anything to write home about. The sandwiches are gigantic! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. The ingredients, as a standalone are halfway decent - the fries are the real deal and pretty good, the coleslaw is fresh and crunchy, etc. I just don't get why the sandwich is raved about. Overall my sandwich was pretty flavorless, not even salty. I wish there was a distinguishing flavor apart from like \"yep, that's egg, yep that's cabbage, yep, that's a potato.\" \n\nAh well, it took me almost ten years to get around to visiting this place, and I don't think I'm too keen on going back. :-/ When I lived in Pittsburgh, I was always trying to find the best Thai restaurant. I failed miserably. So when I visited for July 4th, I had a friend take me to her favorite place. This was it! and I was grateful!\n\nI went with about 8 people and we BYOB'ed which was a fantastic idea. Some semi-sweet white wine went well with the flavorful light Thai food. Most of the table had the curries(I thought the red was the best), but I went with the eggplant with the vegetarian duck. Simply delicious! Highly highly recommend it. The spicy basil sauce was the highlight. My partner had one of the chef specials, which was by far the most interesting, but maybe not the tastiest. \n\nOverall, an affordable, low-fuss, great place to eat. There also seemed to be a steady crowd there when we got there and left. It looks like a popular spot. For good reason! Two Words: Frozen Cosmos\n\nYou need no other motivation to go to Harris' (although, the food and service is good too) I use to pass by this place all the time. It always seemed dark and dingy from the outside. I still haven't been for the nightlife, but we ended up here for breakfast because there was literally nothing else open on the morning of July 4th. \n\nI was open to the idea of eating here, but the breakfast was pretty disappointing. My friend's chocolate chip pancakes were small in diameter, undercooked and only had a few chips per pancake. My breakfast burrito didn't have the cheese I asked for and was pretty average. I needed a lot of ketchup because they really didn't try to put much salsa in it. My friends bacon was tiny (I mean, 1 inch long, 1/4 inch wide) and far too salty. Anyway, I wish I wasn't so hungry or I wouldn't have gone here in the first place.

{"text": "Mitchell's was surprisingly good.  Everything I tasted was good or better, and there were plenty of options.  Everything I drank was good or better, and there are options for everyone.  The atmosphere was great (especially sitting outside on one of the rare nice days), which definitely enhanced the experience (though don't count on that part being reliable in Pittsburgh...).  My dings against the place are mostly minor (e.g., tiny hiccups in service), but for one: it's a bit pricey for the category in which I'd place it, though it's still a great option in that category. The food is good, and excellently spiced.  Though others on this site have reported not being able to get dishes spicy enough, I've never had that problem (when I've ordered 10 out of 10, I got 10).  In fact, that's one of my favorite things about this restaurant: they cook the food exactly the way I want it, pretty consistently.  Sauces are creamy; meat is tender; and prices are reasonable.  I'd say this is easily one of the better Indian restaurants in the city, which is saying something given the plethora of good options. I can't figure out the hype surrounding the burgers here.  It's at or near the top of more \"Best Burger in Pittsburgh\" lists than not, and some people have gone so far as to name it the best burger in the state.  I've had burgers at well over 100 places in this state, and let me tell you, Tessaro's isn't even average.\n\nThe ingredients were of good quality, but both creativity in design and skill in preparation were sorely lacking.  I went with a group of five, and not one of us enjoyed the burger.  Also, not one of us got ours cooked as ordered.  I'm willing to accept a variety of interpretations of \"medium rare\" but no pink and dry throughout is not one of them.\n\nThough shamefully mistreated, the meat's natural flavor, along with non-burger items, rescued Tessaro's from one star territory, but it was pretty obvious the clueless kitchen couldn't hold up to real competition.  (If you want a decent burger, try Burgatory.) Meh.  The Harris Grill is one more American business in a long line to have great ideas ruined by terrible execution.  An entire page of delicious looking burgers?  Bland and overcooked.  Cool looking spaces?  Can get cramped and awkward with groups, and sometimes it's hard to get a server or bartender to notice you (I've never once thought a group outing here was anywhere approaching \"comfortable\").  And what about the famed BACON NIGHT?  It's not even good bacon!\n\nThey'll have to knock their game up several notches to achieve the potential contained in their great ideas. It's a nice enough place with a decent selection of drinks (and a not-bad post-9pm happy hour), but I'd steer clear of the food.  If the portions were large and delicious, the prices would be more than reasonable, but sadly that's not the case.  I've never really enjoyed anything I've eaten here, and the downright terrible burger is what prompted me to write the review warning folks away (\"medium rare\" came out \"well done\" and no one noticed or even asked how it was).\n\nSo come here if you want to grab a drink with your friends on Walnut Street.  But I, for one, will be going someplace else first if I want dinner too. Cappy's provides a welcome relief from the high prices on Shadyside's posh Walnut Street shopping and dining district.  The food isn't great, but it isn't bad either, and the prices for food and drink won't break the bank.  The menu also boasts quite a few options, and anyone looking for standard bar fare in this increasingly ritzy area may find a haven at Cappy's.  I'd never call this place delicious or wonderful, but I certainly wouldn't want it closing up shop either.", "user_id": "8syjbjJRkzxK9RUaKewUrg", "business_id": "usSROUMiAgPcxV3Ym0OxMQ"}
{"text": "This is by far my favorite Panera location in the Pittsburgh area. Friendly, plenty of room to sit, and good quality food & coffee. Panera is a great place to hang out and read the news - they even have free WiFi! Try their toasted sandwiches, especially the chicken bacon dijon. A decent Italian restaurant serving delicious fresh made bread with hummus, flat breads, salads, soups, and pasta. Outdoor seating is available in nice weather, and the service is friendly. Overall, not a bad place, but not super exciting either - Pino's suffers from its close proximity to the excellent  Point Brugge Cafe. It also gets quite noisy inside so it's hard to carry on a conversation, and seems to attract a somewhat older crowd of people. This was one of the worst dinners out I've had in recent memory. On the other hand, I wasn't expecting much, so I guess the place lived up to my expectations. I've been trying to think of a good way to describe their food, and the best I can come up with is as follows. Imagine a cafeteria pasta dinner you might have been served as a child away at summer camp, and you'll have a pretty good idea. In other words, the food is perfectly edible here, but boring, and nothing you would want to actually pay for. There was nothing disgusting about it, it was just extremely uninspiring. To be fair, I only tried the pasta, bread, salad, soup, and calamari, so maybe they have amazing pizza here... It's possible, although unlikely based on what I've seen.\n\nOn the upside, the service was friendly enough, and there were plenty of empty tables at prime dinner time! If you're hungry, you'll definitely be full when you leave. Yes! Awesome soy cap, scone, and atmosphere. Nice place to hang out & read, and free WiFi with no login procedure. Kind of small, but I've had excellent luck with produce here: fresh and organic. In-store coffee bar is a nice plus. Wow, just wow. That was without a doubt the worst \"pizza\" I've ever had in my life. Maybe you would like it. Do you like all of your toppings out of a can? I didn't even know you could get canned green bell peppers. Do you like your slices of pizza to be covered with a huge several inch thick mound of uncooked mozzarella cheese? If answer is yes, then maybe this place is for you. It is definitely not for me. Their chicken BBQ pizza is among the greaseiest I've ever consumed, but their beer selection is good, atmosphere is pleasant, and service is friendly. Best tortillas in Pittsburgh - made in the store! Also a decent taco stand outside. Like the other Big Burrito group restaurants, this restaurant features excellent food. Sat at the bar and enjoyed wine, a seafood dinner, and dessert. Fairly fancy although you can get away with wearing jeans. A nice quiet atmosphere with good service and excellent food. I've tried many sushi places in Pittsburgh, and flavor/presentation wise, this was clearly the winner. The sushi here is so good you want to just let it melt in your mouth and savor each piece. Only drawback is the price! Highly recommended. This is a great place to go for a special dinner. I've been here twice, and on both occasions had a wonderful three hour long dinner. The food is delicious, the atmosphere is pleasant and relaxed feeling, and the waitstaff are friendly. My only complaint about Umi is the exorbitant price! A decent place to hang out on weekend mornings. Decent coffee, tasty bagels, and so-so bagel sandwiches. I've tried several of their sandwiches and been disappointed, but I'd still recommend this location overall.

Pizza is good- cheesy and delicious. I like the sausage pizza here as well. The steak and meatball hoagies are our favorites. Service is fast and friendly. Large take out pepperoni pizza filled a delicious hole on a really cold night! It was ready in 15 minutes and was exactly what I was looking for in a take out pizza. Chewy crust, zippy sauce, greasy cheese, and tasty meat. Will be back! Peoples is my  favorite delivery place! Love the garlic nan but I will say it's better in house than delivered. The mango chicken is delicious. We always order a biryani rice dish. From the vegetarian list love the vegetable Shia korma- but will mention it is very rich, the aloo sagg, and the shai kofta- also quite rich. The lunch buffet is good and love that you can have chai with it because their chia is tasty. It's funny we never eat in for dinner so I have no idea what that's like. But yeah take out for dinner and buffet for lunch. Love! I really like Silky's- it's a great little bar with a good two list. Last time I was there the southern tier 2xipa was on. So. Good. I had the Reuben and was so happy with it. \nCrispy buttery bread with corned beef and sauerkraut. The fries on the side were crispy and soft in the middle.\nI'll be back! I dream of the panang curry from thai cuisine. It's so delicious. \n\nService here is great and ordering over the phone is a breeze. We start with thai iced teas which are sweet and delicious. The tom kah soup or dumplings are great to start. We get tom kah with veggies and extra spicy. It is so good. \n\nLike I said the panang curry is so good. It has lots of broccoli and we get it with chicken and veggies. It can get really spicy so be aware. The spicy basil noodles, spicy thai fried rice, and the pad se ew are other favorites! \n\nTake out is great- usually 20-30 minutes. Packed up and waiting for you. It's byob so if you eat in grab a six pack! Soba had become one of our regular spots for big family dinners. Most recently we came for my sisters birthday. I was able to get reservations for 7 at the last minute for Saturday night. We had a long table next to the waterfall on the first floor. It was a high top so it wasn't the most comfortable but for a last minute reservation it worked.\n\nWe started with the calamari which was delicious and then dived right into entrees. I had what I always get- the seared tuna. It's crusted with sesame seeds and comes with rice, BBQ sauce, Kim chee, and pickled vegetable. It's so delicious I never get anything else. I had bits of my moms duck which was also delicious and the boyfriends sea bass was amaze! \n\nWe did not stay for dessert at this visit but in the past I have enjoyed the ice cream with cashew dessert. Soba is really so good. And it looks to beautiful. I've never had the pleasure of staying here but this is where my boyfriends mom stays when she is in town. They've been very nice to accommodate my boyfriend and I even though we are not staying so I've had a few breakfasts here. They food is always delicious- usually a sweet or savory option plus a classic eggs, toast, meat, bread. The French toast is delicious. The bacon is so yummy crispy delicious. Coffee here is really good! \n\nThey have a beautiful back patio and a station with coffee and tea out all the time. So I've spent a few afternoons enjoying that.

And of course...\n\nCHOCOLATE MAKI ROLL!\n\n*sigh*\n\nThis place loses 1 star because I can't afford to go here as much as I'd like. Really fun place to go, especially if you have a sense of humor and enjoy good food.\n\nI've been here twice and never been disappointed.  Their menu descriptions change periodically, as if one of their staff members got a degree in comedy writing but hasn't made his/her big break yet.  It's always fun reading the menu for the quirky stories that poke fun at CMU students or current events or what have you.\n\nMenu content aside.  I've never been disappointed with the food.  The fish tacos are definitely an excellent bang for the buck, at under $10 (maybe under $9 but I don't recall exactly) and comes with a side of your choice.  The spinach dip is delicious but just a tad too cheesy for me.  I had one of their pasta dishes a long time ago, loaded with chicken and vegetables, which was one of their pricier items, but it was a large dish so I was able to eat it the next day.\n\nAlso, if you're not driving, please try their dessert drinks.  Or at least read the menu for it.  You'd have to splurge a little, but they're still worth a try.  For those not interested in dessert drinks or mixed drinks, the beer selection is decent here, too.\n\nOverall, I like coming here.  It's kind of like entering a house, with the various seating areas -- tables if you like (inside or outside), or couches if you prefer to lounge around.  The lighting is dim but warm.  Music is contemporary and lively.  It's a great place for young people. Went on a Friday night at about 10:30pm for a late dinner.  It was a nice night out and definitely not conventional dinner time so we were seated quickly inside the restaurant while the patio remained popping with young professionals having drinks.  Some middle-aged men were drinking at the bar inside.  The service was great, most likely because no one else was eating at this hour.  The restaurant itself looks great, no criticisms there.  Clean and homey, nice mood lighting.\n\nMost meals come with their appetizer salad.  I asked for their house special Lemon Mustard dressing.  It was an excellent choice and I highly recommend it.  It tastes like honey mustard but lightened so it's appropriate as a dressing and not as a dipping sauce for chicken nuggets XD\n\nTwo glaring flaws about our dinner -- my Charles Pasta was too salty and my friend's Chicken Roulade was too bland.  It was ridiculous.  I tasted my pasta and did an Alex Guarnaschelli when she's judging on Chopped, thinking in my head \"Did you taste your food?  No?  Well, you definitely substituted salt for sugar.\"   The Charles Pasta probably would've benefited from sugar rather than salt, since it contained sausage already, which provides much of the salty flavor.  I tasted my friend's Chicken Roulade.  The salt should've gone there, for sure.\n\nThe chocolate torte cake for dessert was delicious and redeemed the meal somewhat. This place is a little pricey and pretentious for what it offers.  The menu's kind of short and not always easy on the wallet, especially the daily specials supplement.  The ambiance is neat, but like all other reviewers have said, it gets loud.  I think it contributes to a classy, European feel though.  My boyfriend and I don't talk too much when we eat so the noise wasn't a problem.\n\nI had the spaghettini which has spinach and clams.  It was watery, but didn't water down the taste so it's forgivable.  My boyfriend had the ravioli (I forget what the filling was, but I don't think it was vegetarian).  The sauce with the ravioli -- a vodka-type sauce -- was tasty and great for dipping bread.\n\nDespite NOT ordering the cheapest items on the menu, we were still perceived as cheap college students (maybe we should've dressed up a little?).  The waitress gave us the check immediately after we finished without interesting us in coffee or dessert.  A shame.  We were planning to order tiramisu, but we decided to watch our waists anyway and just paid and left.  Tsk tsk.", "user_id": "eBr8bLuZBWzaSdkMq6zH_A", "business_id": "9SPwF-vRgtuHxciFxv5YLA"}
{"text": "VERDICT:\nThe best meal I've had in Pittsburgh! Yes - this beats out the likes of Casbah, Eleven, Nine on Nine, and Tamari.\n\nFOOD:\nExcellent. Having heard enough good things, we opted for the Omakase (chef's choice). Course after course of sensationally prepared sashimi and nigiri-sushi, with sauces that were flavorful enough to set off the fish, yet delicate enough not to overpower it. \n\nMr. Shu presented us with Maguro (Tuna), Hamachi (Yellowtail), Hirame (Fluke), Kanpachi (young Yellowtail), Saba (Mackerel) and a few others. Miso soup, of course. There was one cooked course - a buttery soft fillet of cod that simply melted in the mouth.\n\nThe culinary delights continued with desserts. I got the chocolate maki, which was rich and delicious. Thankfully, it was also the only time that maki made any sort of an appearance at the table. Truth be told, I was a little apprehensive that the Omakase would include a few courses of maki, especially since the table next to us seemed to be busy wolfing down California rolls.\n\nAll in all, an excellent tasting menu. Portion sizes were just right, with enough food to leave you happily sated, but not stuffed. I was surprised to see reviews complaining about the small portion sizes - sushi is not something that you traditionally expect to find in Cheesecake Factory size portions!\n\nSERVICE:\nService was about average. Servers were friendly, helpful and knowledgeable, but a little on the slow side. We had a reservation and we were seated within a few minutes. It took us a little while after we were seated for them to get our drink order and there were a few other times when we were looking for a server but couldn't find one. \n\nAMBIANCE:\nThis is really the only thing I'd knock about Umi. I feel like they had the potential to really go for an upscale Japanese look and didn't. Instead, it feels a bit haphazard, with a mish-mash of a traditional and contemporary that doesn't quite mesh. It's by no means bad though - it was comfortable and enjoyable - just not up to its potential.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\nThis is a place you can take your friends who are visiting from NYC or Philly and have it more than hold its own. Do yourself a favor and skip the grocery store rolls and go for the Omakase. OVERALL:\nGiven the popularity of Girasole, I was disappointed that this place didn't even come close to living up to the hype. Although there were some highlights, there were plenty of negatives to counter them.\n\nSERVICE:\nDespite having a reservation, we were made to wait for over 45 minutes for a table, standing outside in the cold. Also, we were only given cutlery for two of the three people in our party. Not a good start. Once seated, though, the service was good. Our server, Vito, was pleasant and attentive.\n\nFOOD:\nDisappointing. The bread brought to our table was stone cold, and the accompanying butter was rock hard and still in the commercial packaging. I expect to get butter in little plastic tubs at a diner, but not at a relatively upscale restaurant like Girasole. Furthermore, the fact that the bread was cold and the butter was practically frozen made it impossible to spread. Not a good start. \n\nFortunately, it improved from there. The salad course was the highlight of the meal - the greens were crisp and the addition of sunflower seeds and bleu cheese crumbles gave it wonderful texture and flavor. This was the best part of the meal.\n\nMy steak was tender and the meat was of good quality. However, it was a tad under-seasoned and the accompanying risotto was undercooked and quite bland. The polenta that was served with my wife's chicken was also bland and under-seasoned. \n\nDesserts were average. I had the chocolate mousse cake, which sounded delicious, but ultimately the quality was on par with what you would get at a supermarket bakery. My wife had the coconut cream cake, which turned out to just be yellow cake with some coconut frosting.\n\nAMBIANCE: \nProbably the best thing about this place. It is quaint and intimate. The decor is charming and it's in a lovely location.\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\nProbably a better bet on an off-peak night and when the weather is nicer, but if it's a busy night and it's cold out, I'd give it a miss.", "user_id": "0edBFqQUtd80MFidAp9etQ", "business_id": "Cy9XgM3ZG2jZ1ganvolb6Q"}
{"text": "I only went here to have a few drinks, and talk with a friend who wasn't sure if he wanted to eat or not. We were escorted to a table and were cool, the waitress was friendly and tentative since our conversation was rollin'. Long story short we were there for 5 hours, just drinking, and if our waitress could of re-worded her words, our experience wouldn't have been so sour. She came over and stated \"I'm leaving here is the check, if you would like to stay you're more then welcome to order from the bar.\" So we continued to talk not thinking anything of it, or someone was going to pick up her tip. WELL not two minutes later she comes back to us and says \" IM LEAVING, I need you to pay your check.\" At this point me being me, gets a little annoyed, as my friend is looking at me like no she didn't! So he paid as a gentlemen do, and we continued the night, as they dimmed the lights and shut off the music we got the hint we've been talking way to long. If she could have been a tid more polite, it would have been a good experience. The atmosphere was great, the food looked good, but your sour mouth ruined it all. Love finding these hole in the wall spots in my backyard, I call Pittsburgh. My friend had taken photos for Pittsburgh Magazines Blog, and demanded I go and try it. Let me tell you, Italy has arrived in this place. The owner, was there during our time and they display outside seating, as well as indoors. Their indoor seating is I feel below street level with brick walls, and community art hanging on the wall. Which rumor has it, you can buy. \nAs recommended I made a reservation, and was seated immediately. Big up, right there not including the atmosphere, very rustic, very homey Italian to me. We were greeted by our server, and I ordered a water with one of their \"special, owner loves this drink\" my friend ordered another specialty drink. I noticed the prices and strayed away from the appetizers, so I could order my entree and dessert. When our bread arrived I noticed this neat little oil holder, it was shaped like a jug, with a grape mold that held the balsamic vinegar. I WANT that thing. I almost walked away with it, pocket pinched it, but here comes running; in my conscious, knowing that my awful deed would have split all over my purse, knowing my luck. Any-hoo, haven't met a place to go wrong with bread. My drink that I ordered wasn't my kind of drink, there were bitters involved, and my taste buds and bitters don't get along. I told the waitress, and she agreed and said not everybody likes the drink, I'll take it off your bill, and I ordered another, which was amazing. \nAs for their menu, they do have specials that coincide with the season. They have to make a bang for their buck, can I please recommend they print that seasonal menu on another kind of paper..other than computer paper?! I was a little bummed out about that. I ordered the cocoa fettuccine, with pistachios, leeks, cauliflower, and Gorgonzola. This is a late post, but I can still taste this pasta. HOUSE MADE pasta, you can't go wrong. This pasta was just amazing. absolutely amazing. My mouth is watering as I type, Now you know this is a good place, if I'm drooling. The love I have for this restaurant is intensified if you have tried their spinach and ricotta ravioli, in this creamy tomato sauce. That you could tell was authentic, or well their own recipe. I seriously can't get enough of this place.\nOn to dessert, I ordered the white chocolate raspberry gelato. Real chunks of raspberry and white chocolate, it was just an awesome ending to a great meal.

{"text": "This review only encompasses my 2-3 experiences with burgers - THE thing Tessaro's is known for. All I can say is - I don't get the hype. If it weren't for the blue cheese and bacon it would have been borderline inedible. There didn't seem to be any seasoning of the meat whatsoever. Bland would be an understatement. \n\nPoints for using fresh hand formed beef and consistently preparing it at the requested level of done-ness, but I don't know how the burger here even enter any debate regarding the best burger in the 'Burgh. I'd even say Lot 17 a few doors up has more flavorful burgers - saying nothing of places like Wingharts and Burgatory.\n\nService is always friendly and prompt - but the food is just...OK. I think this place is just more of a Pittsburgh tradition like the similarly overrated Primanti's. I'll second the other reviewer that said for the price charged, the amount of food you receive doesn't measure up. Furthermore, Pittsburgh still has yet to have any quality schawarma. \n\nI ordered both the beef and chicken schawarma to sample. \n\nThe beef:\n\n- clearly frozen boxed 'steak-ums' as opposed to freshly shaved off a doner.\n- a measly 2 slices at that, I basically had a wrap of lettuce and tomato w/ a hint of beef\n\nThe chicken:\n\n- clearly a once frozen and somewhat freezer burnt sliced chicken breast again as opposed to being freshly sliced off a doner and a mix of white and dark meat. this leaves the meat dry and tasteless. \n- maybe a half of a chicken breast if I was lucky\n\nNo toum or similar sauce served at all with either dish?!?! That's hitting a whole new low for fake schawarma. \n\nHostess was great, service was adequate. I have no motivation to return. \n\nHopefully one day Pittsburgh will have good choices when it comes to Greek and Med. food. Today is not that day. A last minute cancellation afforded me the rare opportunity to have a weeknight dinner at a 'normal' person's time, so I decided to redeem one of my many (READ: TOO many) Groupons. \n\nOn the left: The \"I Can Has Bacon Cheezburgher?\" cooked to medium-rare perfection on the optional pretzel bun. A solid and above average burger for certain. Not quite on the level of Winghart's Burger & Whiskey Bar or Burgatory Bar, but also without the price tag that comes with those burgers. Head & tails above any burger I've had at Tessaro's! \n\nOn the right: The \"Kielrogieretzel Sliders\" - kielbasa, sauerkraut, whole grain mustard, and cheese-stuffed pierogi together in mini pretzel buns. Yeah, those were about as awesome as they sound, albiet alsightly overpriced for what you get. I think I've found a new place to add to the short rotation. \n\nNOTE: Not pictured was the Cookies-N-Cream dessert, which in their words is: \"A freshly baked chocolate chip cookie of prodigious diameter served hot out of our Easy-Bake oven (powered by a 40-watt light bulb) in a lethal cast iron skillet with French vanilla ice cream. Give us a few minutes to make this: mom's baking these.\"\n\nOne of the better desserts I've had, so I devoured it before photographic evidence could be obtained. \n\nIf I needed any more evidence this place is kinda place, Tuesdays are 'Bacon Night'!\n\nThis was on a Wednesday around happy hour - atmosphere was chill, quiet, and relaxed. Service from Byron behind the bar was attentive without being overbearing. Nice people. LOUD!\n\nWhen someone says the name Girasole's - that's the first thing that pops into my head. So loud you have to essentially shout to have a conversation with your table-mate. Small place, so everything is pretty cramped together. \n\nService is quick, genuine, and attentive. Food was slightly above average but far from memorable - just not worth putting up with the noise level over. Perhaps for takeout....\n\nHad the greens and beans w/ the Cappa Santa.", "user_id": "NkVT_LGJJ7zc4soQ2FrayQ", "business_id": "vgXE1I7c9ElcfYyZfQiN1Q"}
{"text": "I enjoyed my meal at Alla Famiglia. The service is great and the atmosphere is OK (a little oddly decorated for such a high-end eatery). However, I don't know that the food was so good that it justified the high price point. This place is expensive and reserved for special occasions, which I knew coming in, but I wasn't really that blown away by my meal. You do get A LOT of food, but walking away with $300+ bill for a group of 4 just seems over the top when you consider the fact you're eating mostly pasta. I went to Max's for the first time with my family a few weeks ago. I ordered the kielbasa sandwich with a side of kase spaetzle. The kielbasa on the sandwich was topped with a serving of sauerkraut and served on a toasted roll.  It was your average kielbasa sandwich. Satisfying, but nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nThe kase spaetzle however was noteworthy and delicious. It was smothered in gouda cheese sauce and I love me some gouda! I ate it all and I would have licked the plate if it were socially acceptable. \n\nAs for the environment, the restaurant is housed in what looks like what might of used to be a house back in the day. It had lots of little dining rooms. The decor was kind of outdated, but I think that's what you'd expect and it's part of the charm. The tables were spaced a little too close for my liking, but it was tolerable. \n\nOverall, I'd go back if invited, but I don't know if I'd go again on my own. It's hard to beat the atmosphere of this place in the summer. It's outdoor dining is right on the river, hovering above Washington's Landing Marina. However, the service is seriously lacking. With my parent's boat docked right below Redfin's, we frequently dine here before headed out on the water. The service has always been very slow. I understand that on a typical Friday or Saturday night it can get rather busy, but they should anticipate the crowd and be able to plan accordingly to accommodate! Luckily, the view is so nice that most of the time we're left waiting....and waiting....and waiting....it isn't too big of a deal because we're enjoying the outdoor space. \n\nThe food is average. Nothing I've had there was to die for, but on the same token, nothing was awful either. I'd only suggest this place to marina-goers or those looking for a nice outdoor dining space. Oh, and only come if you have lots of time! Cappy's! We went here for karaoke night and stayed til close. We didn't try any food, but ordered plenty of drinks. We sat at a table and the waitress was super attentive and checked back often to see if we needed another drink. It was a full house, but not too full where you can't move. The Karaoke was good and you could tell there were some regulars hitting the stage. There were a few times they didn't have songs someone in our group requested, which we thought was a little weird because they were top 40. While Girasole serves delicious and authentic italian food, it is not for the faint of heart! The owner here can be very intimidating and if you're here during peak hours like Friday or Saturday night without a reservation? Forget about it.\n\nThe owner is the one who seats guests, but from what I observed, he doesn't have a very official seating system. I wasn't very confident that he was truly seating guests without reservations in the order in which they arrived. I understand that certain party sizes will be seated before others, regardless of arrival time, but even still, it didn't seem very legit. They'd benefit greatly from an experienced hostess. We had a reservation and were seated 45 minutes after our time. There was a group of 5 that arrived without a reservation a few minutes after we arrived and they were still waiting for a table after we finished eating and left nearly 2 hours later. God bless their patience!\n\nThe restaurant is very small and they cram as many tables and seats into this place as possible, making it very difficult to get around everybody to get to your table and exit. You cant get in and out of this place without at least a half dozen excuse me's. I know that more tables = more money, but they could definitely stand to remove a few tables to improve the comfort of their customers. But maybe this kind of atmosphere is their goal? A loud restaurant with close seating...very family like. Either way, I'm not sure it's for me.\n\nThe food here is very good and worth returning for. I had a garlic sauce pasta that was cooked to perfection. My husband had pasta with meat sauce that he said he really enjoyed. My friend and I shared a chocolate cake that was rich, moist and perfectly sweet.\n\nIn the summer, this place is likely more tolerable as they have outdoor seating, so I might give it a try again come summer. But as for winter, if you want a place where you can have a conversation, good luck being heard over all the noise. If you like your personal space when dining, this joint is not for you!

{"text": "It may not look like much, but don't judge a book by its cover. If you are looking to grab a quick lunch and you like gyros, look no further! \n\nWhat I like about this place is everything is basically already made. You are in and out in no time. I have had their stuffed grape leaves and gyros both equally delicious and did I happen to say filling. They really stuff the grape leaves and load up the gyro with meat and other toppings. The tzatziki sauce was different compared to other tzatziki sauces I have tried. It's on the thicker side, which I really liked because it wasn't running everywhere. The prices are reasonable and the food is good! It's been 3 days since Yelps Swingin to Summer event and I had to get my Soba fix in. Pulling up to the restaurant you will see they have a valet service (tip based) which is awesome since parking in Shadyside can get tricky. I have seen a lot of pictures of the bar and lounge area from other reviews but I was really blown away by the interior design of the dining room. It was very modern and upscale! I also really loved the sliding doors it really opened up the area and let in a nice breeze. \n\nI knew going into this dinner the filet satay was a must and so were the pork belly buns. My mom wanted to try the spicy chicken lettuce wraps so we ordered that as well. With the filet satay you get 3 skewers that come with 4 pieces of filet that basically melt in your mouth! The pork belly buns were also heavenly. There was a nice mix of flavors happening here, sweet and tangy! Last but not least the spicy chicken lettuce wraps delivered as well. My mom did say they were the best chicken lettuce wraps she has ever had and she is a big chicken lettuce wrap eater. They were not spicy at all which is what she was originally worried about. The halved peanuts, green peppers and caramelized onions really added extra flavor and crunch. The portions were very generous for these all being shareable. Next time I would like to try the Korean bbq ribs for sure! \n\nSoba you are definitely on my favorite restaurant list and I recommend everyone to try it for themselves. Yesterday was Sunday and what do most Italians do on Sunday's? They have Sunday dinner. My mom and I wanted to try out a new Italian restaurant and while a lot of the Italian restaurants are closed on Sunday's, Girasole was opened! It was on my list of restaurants to try and we were not disappointed. \n\nThey opened at 4 and we were the first ones to be seated. It did not take long for the place to fill up because it is pretty small inside. I wouldn't suggest bringing a large party here. Though it may be small, I loved the atmosphere. I loved the stone walls and fancy European paintings on the walls. \n\nOur waitress was excellent and very accommodating. I ordered the potato gnocchi with mozzarella and a whole lot of sauce and my mom ordered the ricotta cavatelli with brown sauce and pine nuts. Instead of the lamb meatballs she substituted it with shrimp. We each got salads that were very delicious and a pretty decent size. Some of the toppings included, sunflower seeds, chickpeas, tomato and mozzarella to name a few. The bread they brought out was also very fresh!\n\nWe were in and out very fast, the service was prompt and we like that!

{"text": "We recently moved from Pittsburgh to Palo Alto, CA.  It's beautiful, and the food is great, but we've yet to find an Italian restaurant that is even half as good as Girasole.  Pittsburgh has one of the greatest Italian restaurants around in this little gem just off Walnut street.  \n\nFrom the sunflower salad oil to their filet special, and the pumpkin ravioli, I never once in 10 years had a bad dinner here.  Never even had an okay dinner.  They were all outstanding, and served with such personality that we always felt welcomed by Jimmy and his family. After 2 years on the west coast, we finally made a trip back to the burgh for dinner, and Girasole was the first place we had to go. Maybe it's nostalgia, but we felt like it was an off night. The chicken special, which was our normal go-to, seemed out of place--chicken with couscous and yogurt at an Italian restaurant? We longed for the artichoke and risotto chicken specials from our time living off Walnut street. \n\nThe carne was lamb and the fish was salmon, so we ordered off the regular menu. The risotto was great, the Nero D Avola house wine was perfect, but it felt like the Girasole of our memories had slipped a bit.\n\nNo doubt it will be the first place we go next time we come back, but here's to hoping for a return to more robust specials. \n\nBTW, Jimmy Pie, the guy with the wine is always super friendly and accomodating. He always remembers my dad when my parents come to town, and he always gets us a table as quickly as he can. Yes, they are not always clear on reservations, but this place has been a staple for 10+ years and, with the small space, they do the best they can to accomodate everybody. It's the price you pay for authentic Italian food in a city where Bravo! and Olive Garden are consistently voted best Italian food. I came here directly from the airport. Didn't even stop at the hotel. And after two years in San Francisco, this was the best meal I have had. Perfectly cooked filet, Yukon potatoes pur\u00e9ed with fennel...dinner here just gets better and better and better. \n\nIt made the 4 am wakeup, turbulent flights across the country, screaming children, pushy Gate agents and lost luggage worth while.\n\nThank you Jimmy and family for such an amazing meal and welcoming experience. How much I miss you, Girasole. It's me again, the Pittsburgh native living in San Francisco. 3 years later, you are STILL the king when it comes to Italian food, from coast to coast. Speaking of kings, Jimmy Pie is always a welcome sight with his glass of wine and his willingness to make his customers happy. \n\nThis trip I brought a team of coworkers for dinner on our first night, and it was so mindblowingly good (I knew that, but it was their first time after all) that they voted to come back again on our second night. \n\nPlease keep doing what you are doing--amazingly fresh, authentic, satisfying and creative food served by genuinely sweet people in a welcoming space. \n\nIt may be years, but yours are the meals that all others will be judged against, and found lacking. 5stars for Jimmy Pie and this beautiful restaurant. Perfectly cooked salmon, richly rewarding chicken special and being treated like family...thank you Pie, Patti, Vito and the rest of the crew. We brought my family here from Philly for a surprise dinner. The best! Still the benchmark for amazing food, not only in Pittsburgh but beyond. During a recent trip to Philly from San Francisco, my wife and I both lamented how much we missed Girasole, so we surprised my folks with an impromptu drive across the state for a one-night adventure. Dinner was flat out perfect, from the salmon to the filet special. Boy do we miss Girasole, with its super attentive waitresses, the amazingly comforting food, and the watchful eye of Pie and family.", "user_id": "4L7EDnBOiWWlNDCxLoxjlg", "business_id": "xgK6AAhJ-cYBUCSaLzgTuw"}
{"text": "Sometimes I get these intense cravings to stuff hot dogs and greasy french fries in my face. As someone who doesn't eat meat, the hot dog part of that is a rare occurrence. Thankful D's gives the option for veggie dogs. This makes me very happy. It also makes my hangovers happy too.\n\nNot to mention they have an absolutely spectacular selection of bottles and drafts. If I'm not here enjoying the little pleasures in life - such as fat, grease, and gluttony- I'm enjoying another sinful pleasure, booze. Every time I come here I'm overwhelmed with choices. \n\nThis place is magical. I'm sorry, this place is simply not good. Unfortunately, it is yet another example of poorly made Americanized Italian food. Too much cheese, too much butter and cream, and quite possibly the worst bread I have ever consumed at any Italian restaurant in my life. \n\nSomeone had to go out of their way to find bread this flavorless and awful. It's already a travesty that it's served to me before the meal, but to put it on my sandwich! I'm actually offended for Italians, and bread. Yes bread, this is not your best. The eggplant Parmesan served to my mother was soggy, covered with an absurd amount of plastic Parmesan cheese swimming in a bland sauce. My fathers pasta, cream and cheese. Contrary to popular believe, this is not traditional Italian! This is what some would refer to as, terrible and heavy. And the cannoli? Words could not describe my disappointment.\n\nI'll admit it, I'm already an Italian food snob. I cook tons of Italian food for myself, family, and friends, and I only use the highest quality ingredients and go about preparing my meals in traditional southern Italian ways. I've had phenomenal Italian meals at the few great Italian restaurants in this city, so whenever I get the opportunity to eat at another \"Italian\" joint, I'm heading in with high expectations.\n\nIs this what Italian food in Pittsburgh has come too? Seeing other similar Italian places in Bloomfield, I'm sad to say...yes. I'm actually slightly upset even writing this because the waitstaff is charming, and I hear the owners are great, but to pass this off as representative of Italian food is an injustice. If you want a truly great Italian meal please look elsewhere. I've been going to Girasole's for years with my family and friends. I've had basically every vegetarian and fish dish, always to a great pleasure. The wine list is short but excellently prepared, the chianti is always superb - sempre! \nFor those who complain about space clearly do not understand the dynamics of a small restaurant space that would rather have a few tightly packed tables then actually take tables away. Either people would complain about their not being enough tables or that there isn't enough room, Girasoles choose the latter. Dinners are too spoiled in Pittsburgh, they expect good food to be accompanied by enough space for a family of 8, not to mention they have a fear of being close to fellow dinners - though I have no idea why? \nI recommend going for lunch - particularly if you don't like crowds. You'll most likely get to meeting Phi or Geno which guarantees great conversation and a great experience. Just finished another great dish from La Feria, black bean and rice casserole with fried bananas on top - one of their vegetarian daily specials. The fried bananas added a perfect sweetness to this dish, balancing the heaviness of the black beans and rice. Did I detect a little spiciness in the casserole too?\nI love this little Peruvian destination, and it's certainly a great place to pick up a healthy, fresh lunch. A little underrepresented, and I can understand why this place is often confused with a souvenir shop (probably because the decor is devoted souly to Peruvian paraphernalia...that you can buy). I highly recommend going regardless.", "user_id": "c7pBLYgkD3HOEY1IFXvf2w", "business_id": "2X5G4Ujq0s4Wfn4TC7gX0g"}
{"text": "I've been a fan of Girasole since it opened.  I love the quaint, cozy atmosphere and the food has been great 99.5% of the time.  A place for a gathering of friends to chat loudly across the table at each other.  I enjoy both lunch and dinner,  but the evening meal's much more fun. \n\nA seasonal menu offers a variety of traditional dishes, as well as daily specials.  House favorites are the gnocci with mozzarella, polenta with escarole and ravioli are great.  Summertime brings great seafood specials like the seared scallops.  In the fall, definitely try the pumpkin ravioli in a light cream sauce.  \n\nWith dinner, a glass of wine and dessert, you can drop about $45 per person.  The atmosphere is a modern dressy casual, with jeans, jackets and cute summer dresses.  The one room establishment is small, making intimate conversation difficult when you're practically sitting on top of the table next to you.  Definitely not recommended for parties over four.   In addition, if anyone in your party has difficulty climbing steps, I would suggest going somewhere else.  You need to climb down about 7-8 steps to get inside.  Street parking is available throughout the area, there is also a parking garage and two metered lots one block away. Patrons from all over Pittsburgh come to enjoy Pamela's thin and delicious pancakes, huge servings of home fries and three egg omelets - and they should.\n\nThe first of the Pamela's family, this Shadyside staple has been around long before owners Gail Klingensmith and Pamela Cohen decided to branch out across Pittsburgh.  Since 1980, Pamela's has been voted \"Best Breakfast\" by Pittsburgh's City Paper survey.  Not to mention the diner's modest flare received the White House's \"Presidential approval.\"  \n\nIn the fall, while President Obama was on the campaign trail, he ate breakfast at Pamela's.  He loved the crepe-style pancakes so much, he asked Klingensmith and Cohen to prepare a Memorial Day breakfast at the White House for him and dozens of American troops!  Now, that's a good pancake!\n\nI've sampled just about everything on the breakfast menu and, after eight years of patronage, my favorite is still the strawberry hotcakes.  These thinly poured crepes are laid flat, then rolled around a delicious combination of strawberries, brown sugar and sour cream, topped off with a nice dab of whipped cream to truly send your sugar levels through the roof.  They're simple, delicious and just enough not to feel \"stuffed.\"\n\nThe egg and omelet plates come with home fries (chunky sliced potatoes with what appears to be approximately 1/4 small white onion and a 1/2 lb of butter per serving) and your choice of toast.   The spinach and feta omelet with rye is a decent combination.  But as a warning, these plates are not for the weak.  \n\nFor smaller appetites, they do offer fresh fruit bowls, egg white plates and a variety of a la carte items.  \n\nThe space is typical of older Walnut Street buildings with typical diner flare - simple painted brick with tables bolted to the walls.  On weekends, the room get's pretty cramped.  (A note to parents with small children: if you have large strollers, it may be a good idea to either leave them in the car or ensure they pack neatly in the corner.)  If you get there around 11:00 a.m. the wait can run you about 30 minutes or more, and there's literally one small bench to sit at while inside.  Weekday crowds are much lighter.  \n\nParking can be found on the street, or in the metered parking lot located behind the building.  There's no need to feed street meters on Sundays.  \n\nAll in all, this diner is a classic.  It's managed to outlive a lot of other local businesses while the larger corporate chains have moved on the street.  Perhaps it's the presidential influence, perhaps because it's \"cash only,\" but I think it's because the food is good, down-home cooking.", "user_id": "m4MsXJayMA-qV-6FmAbCiQ", "business_id": "xgK6AAhJ-cYBUCSaLzgTuw"}
{"text": "I had lived outside of Pittsburgh for a couple of years and have eaten at this Primanti Brothers location four or five times. Their sandwiches were always tasty, worth the wait and the trouble of finding parking etc. So, when my parents came to visit, and we made a trip out that-a-way, I knew that would be a lunch stop. We ended up coming into Pittsburgh on Sunday around 1pm. I knew it would be crowded and anticipated having a wait. We got a table after 15 to 20 minutes and quickly sat down before someone else did. It took the waitress about 10 minutes to come and clear the previous customers remnants, which was ok. \n\nWe ordered our beers and were told that she'd come back and take our order. She came back 20 minutes later, with the beers and took our order. After that, we sat around and waited for our sandwiches for 35 minutes. When we did finally get our food, it was ice cold. The fries in the sandwich were completely soggy and cold, and the meat was barely warm. Our table ran out of napkins, and we asked for some, but they never came, finally, the table next to ours handed us a few. Maybe it was because it was cold, but the sandwiches weren't that great. I had very little meat in mine, and more coleslaw that anything else. Also, the thickness of the bread seems to have increased since I last ate here because about 60% of my sandwich was bread. We were fairly disgruntled about the whole thing, but were still going to leave a tip for the waitress. \n\nThen, my dad went to the bar to pay. He stood there for 10 minutes, behind another customer. The server came up to them and said 'what the hell are you doing up here?', in those words!! My dad was so stunned be just stood there, the guy in line ahead of him told her that he was waiting to pay his bill, so she cashed him out and then turned around to do something else, when my dad said 'excuse me, i need to pay too', she replied to him ' Jeez, you guys are so demanding! Why the hell are you in such a hurry\". That is when their tip went straight out the door with us. \n\nWe were ok waiting for a table, we were even ok waiting for our food; it took them one hour from the time we sat down, to the time we got our food, and then the server had the audacity to behave in that manner. Either Primanti Brothers has become too big for their boots and let things slide, or they need to train their staff to be more polite and efficient. We will definitely not be coming back the next time we are in town. Our money is better spent else where. We met a group of friends at Pamela's for brunch, it was my first time at the restaurant and I loved it. This no-frills place serves the best pancakes that I have eaten in a long time. I had their Blueberry pancakes as part of my breakfast combo. My friends had the strawberry pancakes and the french toast with walnuts. All three dishes were delicious (my mouth is watering just thinking about that meal). \n\nThe pancakes are sort of in between flapjacks and crepes, and the blueberries (fresh ones) were folded into the pancake with sour cream  and brown sugar (which complimented the blueberries beautifully).  The rest of my breakfast was tasty too, but nothing to write home about, especially compared to the pancakes. \n\nThey get very crowded and they will not seat you until your entire party is ready to be seated. Also, they do not accept credit cards (CASH ONLY).", "user_id": "TwmGsUuGr3KRcx0gCGxiKg", "business_id": "NeUf9FyCCIN4MEseNyqkXQ"}
{"text": "Rock the Casbah! Rock the Casbah! \n\nA group of us went to the Casbah for a girls' (and one guy) lunch.  It has been ages since I've been to the Casbah, and since I live clear across the country, I was looking forward to going back.  \n\nAll of us enjoyed our meals -- many ordered the Jumbo Lump Crab Chopped Salad or the Wild Mushroom and Goat Cheese Omelet.  Both were nice portions. I was fixated on the Orecchiette Pasta, grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Capriole goat cheese, sage cream, and it was a home run!  (I wasn't watching calories that day!)  \n\nService was excellent . . . surprisingly so, especially with a table of eleven, a bunch of \"Sallies\" and one \"Harry\" if you know what I mean. I've been going to Tessaro's for years. Every trip back to the 'Burgh wouldn't be complete without a lunch or dinner there. It's my go-to place for meeting friends for a meal when we want something tried and true with no froufrou. And I am never disappointed. \n\nI have heard grumblings for the past couple of years that Tessaro's partially cooks their burgers throughout the day and then finishes cooking them \"to order\" so I asked the waitress if I could have a fresh patty, not pre-cooked. She didn't seem bothered by my request. And honestly, I don't know if I would be able to tell the difference. That being said, it still was the best tasting perfectly cooked burger I have had in a long, long time. With all the new specialty burger joints popping up across the country, I still dare any one of them to stand off side by side with Tessaro's. Our usual picks are the Deli and the Bacon-Blue Cheeseburger, but you can pick any burger on the menu and be satisfied, and then some. I also love their home fries. Yummy! The marinated gourmet chicken sandwich is also a winner if you aren't into red meat! \n\nOne of my other favorites at Tessaro's which I have to admit I haven't had in eons since we haven't made it there for lunch recently is the tuna melt on rye. It has been on the menu forever. If you want one, you have to go for lunch as even though its on the lunch menu, they refuse to make it at dinner :( \n\nThe atmosphere here is strictly neighborhood bar/restaurant. Nothing fancy. I am sometimes put off by the way they offer seating (first-come, first-serve) and they will try to cram four people at a table that is meant for only three. If they are not scrambling for tables to seat people waiting, I'd ask for another less cramped table and wait; but on a crowded night, take the first thing available or you could be waiting a long, long time. It has to be at least 25 years since I ate at Pamela's. It was one of my mother's favorite places to grab a quick bite. We met a dear friend on Saturday midday for brunch/lunch, and I ask myself, why did I wait so long to go back, after a multitude of trips back to the \"Burgh\" throughout the years? \n\nI had an omelet -- cooked to perfection. I am a picky omelet eater. My eggs have to be cooked just so . . . and so they were! Truly a rarity. The accompanying potatoes were heavenly. My husband loved his corned beef and hash with eggs and potatoes. The short stack of pancakes that our friend ordered was huge . . . and after one bite, I was in Seventh Heaven. Oh, how I wish I could make pancakes just like that! The thin pancakes, almost crepe-like, with their crispy outer edges are divine. \n\nThis location begs for an aesthetic makeover . . . looks like the same furniture as 25 years ago, but what it lacks there, it makes up for in the yummy food. Service was quick but unremarkable. \n\nNext time we're back in town, we'll definitely stop by for breakfast -- early so we don't have to wait!", "user_id": "8n--xRBQ9eLDi0vpQ5fGFQ", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}
{"text": "Another DDD spot to cross off my list. First one in the East Coast!\n\nI was intrigued with their pumpkin pancakes and raspberry stuffed french toast when I watched the segment on DDD. Finally had the opportunity when I visited by brother for his graduation at Carnegie Mellon. The wait time is killer, so be sure to bring something to entertain yourself for the time being. I think we waited for half an hour, but we weren't terribly hungry, so it was fine. Finally sat down and looked at the menu deciding what to order. Both the pumpkin pancakes and raspberry french toast looked so good, but I didn't want to be a pig and eat both of them (well, I could if I wanted to). My mother suggested that we can order both items and split it from there. Brilliant! Get to taste the both worlds. :)\n\nPumpkin pancakes were delish! A bit on the dense side, yet still fluffy. Spices were so fragrant, like it was Thanksgiving! Not terribly sweet, but at the perfect amount where you don't need the syrup. Huge servings; your serotonin levels will rise. :) The raspberry stuffed french toast would probably have to be my favorite. The crusty/crunchy exterior of the french toast slices stole the stage. The whole dish was sweet enough that syrup was also not necessary.\n\nTheir peach cobbler french toast special looked tempting, but sadly they ran out right when we were seated. Sad. :( I can't really give a food review since I didn't order anything, but there is a reason why I didn't order anything.\n\nMy brother and his friends had the midnight munchies after the whole pub crawling. Being the responsible little sister, I \"chaperoned\" the boys and went the Ritters with them. I wasn't in the mood to eat after midnight, but that's not the reason why I didn't order anything. The reason why I didn't get anything was because when we walked in the diner, I looked at the variety of dishes other patrons ordered and felt slightly sick to my stomach. Must've been my inner conscious that the food is bad news and I guessed correctly. My brother had the Arcadian burger and by sunrise, his stomach didn't settle well. Had no desire to eat throughout the day.\n\nTrust your eyes, nose, and instinct. It's most likely right. Came here for dinner to celebrate my brother's graduation from Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon. Though the reviews were great and food looked yummy, it wasn't exactly how I pictured it. Wasn't aware that the restaurant was SMALL, but we didn't mind sitting outside on a nice sunny day. The menu consisted of simple list of seasonal items. I ordered the spinach ricotta ravioli while my mother and brother ordered the spaghettini with clams. Bread basket is given to much on and a small salad is served with your meal. Very fresh and clean.\n\nThe disappointment started to set in when our food came in. My ravioli only had five pieces and didn't have much filling inside. Can barely taste the spinach. The tomato cream sauce looked old also. The spaghettini my brother and mother ordered looked really good and I wish I could've ordered that instead. They seemed to enjoy it very much.\n\nItalian food is generally expensive, but the quality I was served? Not worth it. I'm from California and hotcakes is something that's not common in our food vocabulary. We just settle on pancakes and call it a day.\n\nMy brother took me and my mother to Pamela's for brunch and it was pretty packed. Fortunately, it was only a 10 minute wait and a huge crowd came in after us. I glanced through the menu and learned that they're known for their specialty hotcakes. They all looked very good, but settled on the the strawberry hotcakes (was craving strawberries). We finally got seated, ordered what we want, and chilled in the lively atmosphere of the diner. The food came out relatively fast and I was ecstatic for my hotcakes. They use FRESH strawberries instead of the syrupy strawberries in a can! The hotcakes were thin like a crepe and the crispy edges were the best part. A bit heavy on the butter, but that's how you get the crispiness. The sour cream surprisingly worked well with the strawberries, as it balanced out the sweetness from its tart element. As for the brown sugar, that was like the cherry on top. It was pure harmony.\n\nDefinitely check it out when you're in Pittsburgh!", "user_id": "8YL4sIcu0LH1PTNYVgeL1w", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw"}
{"text": "I've only been here once (yesterday) for breakfast.  I noticed that this place opens really early (6am) on weekdays so I had thought it would be a nice idea to get down to the Dor-Stop on our way out of Pittsburgh.\n\nI was able to find parking on the street and the meters don't take effect until after 8am.  We had arrived around 7:35 so I figured we'd have enough time before I had to feed the meter.\n\nThere was only 2 other customers at the bar when we arrived.  We had our choice of seating and we had chosen to sit near the window.  Coffee up and ordered and our server was back consistently to make sure our coffees were filled.  On the table we noticed they had non dairy creamer and since both my wife and I aren't fans of non dairy creamer we had asked if we could have a small serving of milk and our server brought that over right away.\n\nBeing our first time I had to go through the menu to see what I was wanting.  I didn't want to eat too much since I had to drive back home but I did find something of interest.  My wife usually gets steak and eggs but she didn't this time.  I had sort of wanted her to get that so I could have some steak but she went with the ham and eggs with German potato pancakes and white toast.  \n\nI had gone with the all American which was 1/3lb burger, eggs, and lyonese potatoes which is basically homefries with onions with toast.  I also ordered a side of bacon.  I noticed the side of bacon was 3.10 which is kind of a lot but they gave me probably 6 slices or more.  I'm used to only getting 3 or 4 slices usually.  \n\nWe didn't order anything that they could impress us with I suppose.  It's not like we went with an item like hotcakes or a skillet or anything like that just a relatively conservative breakfast.  I did have some of my wife's potato pancakes and ham and they were both very good.  My breakfast was just as I expected nothing out of the ordinary but still very good. We go to Pittsburgh maybe twice a year and we always try to go Pamela's every trip.  This place fills up very quickly and I remember often having to line up to get in.\n\nOne of the first things you will notice is that there is a photo of Obama at the cash register right out front.  \n\nSome things to point out before I get to the food is that the washrooms are upstairs through the South American restaurant that shares the same building.  Another thing is that the tables do not move so there is no re-arranging for larger parties.  This place only accepts cash unless they've changed that from the last time I was there it's always been like this at least for this location.\n\nThe tables are small considering the amount of plates you will get when you order breakfast.  Really with the coffee and side plates of toast, hash, etc it will be a balancing act to get everything on one plate maybe...  So if you ordered side of sausage or whatever, if you can throw it on your main plate and stack all the side plates if possible.\n\nNow to the food.  It's damn good period.  I mean breakfast is tough because you can really only twist it so many ways so what makes Pam's special?  The crepes and pancakes is what is unique if I had to pick something.  The crepes you can get will walnut and creme and whatever but they ultimately become humongous and if you had something else like bacon and eggs then you will have no room on your table and in your stomach (maybe) because the portions can be big.\n\nI prefer plain pan cakes with butter and syrup and nothing else added myself... their pancakes... the edges are crispy and light but not too fluffy.  \n\nWe usually get a side of corned beef hash which is just awesome but wow I try not to think about how much sodium is in it especially since I always get bacon too.\n\nThe place has packed for a reason and they're not all tourists because Shadyside is a nice cozy neighborhood.

{"text": "I just moved to Pittsburgh from New Mexico and was excited to hear about this place. Unfortunately, it was not as good as I hoped. The cashier argued with my boyfriend over what kind of dried red chiles to buy, and harassed him when he was browsing the store (she yelled across the store: \"Are you done yet? I already started ringing you up.\"). The house-made corn tortillas were bland and only with the help of a guy running a nearby taco stand (who did not work at Reyna's) did we find the right chiles... The cashier had no idea what we were asking for.\n\nThen there was the Hatch green chile fiasco. Shortly after arriving here, I was searching for Hatch green chile in the area and found out Reyna's would be doing pre-orders. Hooray! I ordered and paid for some online. The website said they would be roasting at the store so I called to ask about it. I was told in a very rude manner that roasting would only happen at the pepper festival, which I would have to pay $7 per person to attend, just to get my chile and get it roasted. Okay, fine. The day before the festival I called the store to confirm that my actual pre-order would be available at the festival. I was mid-question when the clerk on the phone interrupted me: \"What? ... Can you call back later, I'm really busy.\" WTF?\n\nSo I go to the festival to get my chile. The people at the roasting station seem confused when I present my pre-order receipt, but they eventually figure it out, telling me to come back later to get t because it isn't roasted yet. We walked around the festival for an hour then went back, and there is even more confusion over whether ours is ready. Finally they figure it out and give us the roasted chile. Hooray!\n\nOh wait though. We get home and open it up and... Apparently they don't know how to roast it correctly. We bought bulk roasted chiles in New Mexico every year and never had issues peeling it before freezing it. This chile they roasted? It's somehow completely mushy and falling apart, but has almost no visible char, and it's fucking impossible to remove the peel. It's horrible. \n\nSo tl;dr - rude employees, both in person and on the phone. Little product knowledge. And absolutely no knowledge of how to roast green chiles, despite having a whole event around the chiles. I won't be going back. We were shopping on a cold day in the Strip District and decided to try this place for lunch because of the sign advertising the hot lobster roll. It was pretty empty; a few early drinkers at the bar and a few couples seated at tables. I ordered a bloody mary which honestly tasted weird, so I'm not sure what was going on there. For food, we ordered clam chowder, a hot lobster roll, and a fish sandwich. The clam chowder was really tasty with good consistency and was a huge serving, much larger than we expected. The hot lobster roll was rich, buttery, and warm, and the lobster was good and fresh. The fish sandwich was gigantic... two huge fillets breaded and fried with tons of french fries. It was a little greasy but pretty tasty. Overall, I was happy with lunch and with the service and I would probably go again for the lobster roll or the clam chowder. We kept it simple: hotcakes, eggs, and sausage. Everything was cooked properly and was tasty in its simplicity. I'm not a big pancake fan, but these hotcakes were really good. The edges had a caramelized crisp, and the rest of the cake was thin and not overly cakey. It was a really good breakfast.", "user_id": "Ot9p55QOsULbikbJkvcLvw", "business_id": "buVALudg30kgkDusqB3yJw"}
{"text": "It's good if you're in a pinch (or don't have cash) but do yourself a favor and hit-up the original location on 18th street. Seriously, you could walk there...and trust me, you'll need the exercise.. If you're in to typical Pittsburgh pizza then this place is for you. The pizza cooks are named oily and greasy...or at least that's what the final product would suggest. The hoagies are far better than the pizza...but not by much. I'll eat here on occasion, but I would never bring anyone here. Coming to Angelo's, for me, is purely an exercise in self reliance. After visiting Graziano's it's clear why they sell so much booze. You have to be totally plastered in order to find the food edible. The pizza looks like an Exon-Valdez reenactment (enough oil and grease to lube your Hummer) and the sandwiches are just gross. If it wasn't for their location, this place would have been turned into a liquor store decades ago. Avoid at all costs. Finding a good Indian restaurant can always be a challenge. Taste of India is certainly decent...nothing more nothing less. Figuring out the optimal day/time to hit the lunch buffet is like trying to find Gujarat on a map. It's really hard, and you're usually wrong the first few times. That's my main complaint with TOI, somedays the food is really good, other days it's just downright criminal. I think I've figured out their system but trying to explain it would be like.....never mind, you get the picture. I've only been here a handful of times and while the food is good, the one-armed waiter is curt, and the smell is horrendous. I'm guessing the place hasn't been cleaned since the Nixon administration. Either that or they actually buried Nixon under the floor boards without proper mummification. There's gotta be better Vietnamese food in PGH. For me, eating at Tessaro's is like eating a Costco hotdog. When it's happening you're lovin' it. It's tasting good and you're feeling like a red blooded American. When it's over you can't stop asking yourself \"Why did I put that inside me?\" This place makes my GI system do cartwheels 100% of the time. Now, I realize this place has a reputation as a Bloomfield staple, but something they're doing doesn't agree with me. Maybe I should cut down on the Costco dogs? Don't expect anything special here. Most home cooks could outperform the food you'll get at the Pleasure Bar. Fortunately for them, I don't cook...but I can still recognize lazy cooking when I eat it. These guys are definitely lazy! The pasta is precooked, and the sauce is probably bought-in. Nevertheless, the food is edible, but definitely not worth $20. After visiting Girasole on several occasions it becomes immediately clear that these guys think their shit don't stink....when in fact their shit DOES stink, badly. Now, this is not to say the food is inedible...actually some of the appetizers (I.e. the escarole) is quite nice. Unfortunately, the party stops there. The main courses are EXTREMELY overpriced (not unusual for Walnut St.). But if you're gonna charge $15 for penne with marinara sauce at least make it \"to order\". The owner has a glass of wine welded to his hand at all times...hardly the sign of a serious restauranteur. These guys are benefiting hugely from their location and the fact that Shadyside is home to A LOT of rich people who care as much (if not more) about ambience and less about taste. Not sure what was worse the waiter's B.O. (which was akin to a Mumbai locker room) or the fact that this place is most likely owned by the Gambino Crime Family....\"Cash Only.\" The wait is probably the most enjoyable part of this restaurant...which is at least 15-20 min. Our food arrived before we could take off our coats and the check came before I took my first bite of grease. The corned beef looked like mashed goat brains and the pancakes reminded me of Ethiopian sponge bread (apologies to Ethiopia).

If you enjoy chatting with friendly Pittsburgh folk of all walks of life, you've found your place. \n\nFeel free to show up from noon to 4pm when the fish sandwiches are made, I've never had one cause cheese costs $1 for a single slice, same with tomatoes, lettuce, and onions. But since I don't remember eating a sandwich I can't say they're bad. The quality of the food here is fantastic, and I'm happy that's where they spend their money. I don't need Tram's to be impressive in its appearance because I realize it has been and always will be a family run restaurant. It's about the food, and the food here nails it every visit. \n\nI've read reviews commenting on the service, which there is some truth to the level of character presented in the service. Speaking of which, don't stare at Tram, I'm sure he's well aware of the fact that he's missing an arm. Does that get in the way of the delicious food? Not one bit. Don't think that he doesn't understand you either, don't be ignorant. I just heard a woman almost yelling at him. \n\nThe food is great, just try something that sounds good to you. The decor will fade from your mind as you and your companion(s) get a taste of Vietnam in Pittsburgh. Try the fresh spring rolls, better than the egg rolls. I also recommend the vermicelli and coconut milk with shrimp. The pho, curry, and mung bean noodle soup are also wonderful. At the price point of Tram's you can eat here often and eventually try everything. \n\nOh yeah. It's cash only. That makes me like it even more. No separate checks! Sure, the burgers are supposed to be out of this world. I find them kinda meh. But that's because I'm not a fan of burgers. The smell of the grill draws you in from blocks away. \n\nWhat I am a fan of is a place that can actually cook your meat to the requested temperature. By golly, Tessaro's never fails. I ask for a rare steak on the spinach salad, rare it is. Ask for a medium rare burger, done! I overheard a lady praising the kitchen on her well done steak, is that even possible?\n\nI've eaten here MANY times, not that difficult since I've lived in the neighborhood over a decade, and I've heard just about every conversation you could expect. What I've never heard is anyone complaining about the meat temp. \n\nThat is amazing. \n\nSo is the potato salad, though I wish it had egg chunks in it. Huge portions of delicious American pub grub. The prices are reasonable, the food is tasty, and the service at the bar is always professional. Don't come here expecting fast food, it's all made fresh and is of good quality. The Tom Kha is delicious. All of the curry's hit the spot as well, my favorite is the red bean. Thai Cuisine has many traditional dishes as well, don't be afraid to try something you've never had before. As far as my decade of experience goes here, all of the food is good. Mmmm. This place is a must visit breakfast spot. I could go on about the chorizo hash with two eggs over easy, or the croissant French toast with nuts, and the morning after always hits the spot too!

{"text": "I've been plenty and every time I enjoy the food, the drinks, and the environment. I would say it is missing a bit of the down home authenticity that most stellar restaurants in Pittsburgh seem to have. The dishes are inventive and delightful. The patio is perfect on a warm day. For all of these reasons I will continue to show here for an early dinner on occasion. The food was innovative yet underwhelming. The ambiance was causal and quaint but not something I would recommend or choose to do again. Parking was hassle, a reservation is necessary and make sure to not show early. There is no space to wait unless you don't mind sitting outside. I typically wouldn't but as the weather begins to turn it becomes increasingly difficult to enjoy the outdoors. It seems that breakfast or brunch could be a smashing hit here but after my dinner, which I was so looking forward to, I'm not positive that I'm prepared to put this adventure at the top of my list. D's is perfect for those not so fancy afternoons. I love sitting outside with my dog and people watching while sipping on one of their unique beers. the staff is always so helpful with suggestions on what to drink. the pizzas are decent, the salads are my favorite, and the best burger on the menu is the Texas burger. By far the BEST Italian hoagy I have ever consumed! I have been going here since I was a kid, completely unaware of the gold mine I was sitting in I would order a burger and some fries. Don't get me wrong, the burgers are fantastic, but the real star of the show is the hoagy so please oh please. DO NOT LEAVE WITHOUT EATING ONE OF THESE! If your friends and family love you they will take you here and force one of these spectacular sandwiches of the gods upon you. Any human should be so\nLucky to indulge in the toasted, warm, filled to the brim with toppings and dripping with Italian dressing sandwiches of love. Ok, well, now I'm craving one. See you there. The ambiance is perfection. However, I enjoy excellent food, timely service, and well balanced cocktails. If you prefer outstanding decor over all other elements listed. Then I'm sure you will enjoy your experience. I can only hope you trust and find my review helpful. \n\nI accidentally ordered delivery from here after spending a long night working. It was horrible. The fish was tough and the other dish was simply inedible. This place is far too expensive to be serving food poorly prepared. The weather has been beautiful and to celebrate I chose to have a lovely filet of grilled salmon. It was the perfect accent to the wonderful weather. Unfortunately for dinner they do not take reservations. I would say that fact is the businesses biggest downfall. Also there is no area to wait comfortably. You are then forced to Impinge on others dinner experience since there is no removed place to sit and wait. The specials are amazing. This is the perfect place to pick up lunch and go. You can always trust that the food will be both filling and perfect. The vegetarian options are also flavorful and filling. My advice is go experience some Peruvian comfort food. If you love breakfast than this is the place for you. There are three locations so be sure to go to the one closest to you! the pancakes are so delicious that you can't possibly have a bad day if you're starting with a plate of these warm and crispy flapjacks. They have special way of making breakfast potatoes such that you will understand the lines outside on a Saturday.

{"text": "I go to Pho Minh often, but not for their pho, which is okay but not what I would call good.  I usually get their rice or rice noodle dishes served with grilled pork/chicken/shrimp.  The food, in terms of authenticity and quality is okay, but I have to take into account the fact that we're in Pittsburgh and it's hard to find many quality Vietnamese ingredients here.  However, the food is decent and the service is good.  It's a family business, and the couple that owns the place are very nice and courteous.  When I get too lazy to make some Vietnamese food for myself I go make a quick run to Pho Minh. I've been to Tram's Kitchen a few times with friends and I hear good things from people about this place.  Personally, I don't see what is so special about it.  It's kind of a hole-in-the-wall kind of place, but the food is what I expected walking in.  Spring rolls are not flavorful and has too much minced meat and not enough of veggies for a good balance.  Also, I suspect they are the frozen variety and are not made in house.  Summer rolls are meh....  They're big, but again nothing special.  I've had the pho here and once again Pittsburgh disappoints me in the quality of pho that it has.  At Tram's, the pho bowl is small.  I don't expect a huge basin-size bowl, but a bowl of pho needs to have enough noodle, broth, herbs and spiced.  The meat is too overcooked for pho tai (pho with thinly sliced beef steak that is supposed to be cooked only when the boiling hot broth is poured in the bowl).  The taste is reminiscent of pho but isn't quite right.  You need to want to take your bowl and drink all the broth at the end of the meal and you should feel satisfied and be in a comatose state after a good bowl of pho.  This wasn't it.  \n\nThat said, the service is nice.  However, I didn't feel too comfortable/relaxed eating here.  It was dark and crowded (and a little bit dingy).  I prefer dining at Pho Minh to satisfy my Vietnamese cravings. I used to go to Chaya in Squirrel Hill at least once a week, but since I've moved this past summer, it's been difficult to enjoy sushi as frequently.  Thus, I decided to test out Umi based on the good reviews I found on the web.  Sadly, I was grossly disappointed.  The interior decor is pretentious (large water fountain in the middle of the dining room and \"Japanese style\" paintings and decorations throughout) and dark (who likes eating in a place where you can barely see your food?).  The sushi was okay at best, but the quality of the fish certainly does not even come close to Chaya's.  The dishes were overpriced for the quality of the food, basically you'd be paying for the fake ambiance.  I guess the waiter was nice in that he tried to explain our dishes, but frankly he does not know too much.  This is one of those Americanized versions of an Asian restaurant and not authentic (key indicator: most of the patrons were not Asian).  It was nothing that would make me want to come back. Well, to start, crepes aren't a Parisian concept.  They are solely a Brittany thing!  Therefore, the fact that this chain of restaurants carries a name like Crepes Parisiennes is pretentious.  That aside, the crepes are okay, nothing special.  I've had much lighter (crepes here were a bit heavier than they should be) and more authentic crepes elsewhere.  The other thing I do not like about this place are their hours. They are closed by 4pm and on Mondays, and stop serving savory crepes at 3pm???", "user_id": "x8He0Lb78elcW7XJGCvL0Q", "business_id": "uBW3PIKqc-_eyG1_vdJn1w"}
{"text": "I am not huge on hot dogs or beer. However, I am huge on add-ons. This is where D's comes in. I totally recommend the chihuahua hot dog. It has avocado!!! The wings are delish too. This place is a must go for beer lovers. I am still the light and sweet kinda beer person, so I tried something with raspberry notes in it, and LOVED it! Oh and the fries are awe-frickin-some!! My second fave in the city after Point Brugge. This is one of my most favorite brunch places in Pgh! My girlfriends and I would go here over other prix-fixe brunch places at Shadyside because of the value you get. You have a whole antipasti table, full-sized entree and a dessert table plus coffee+bloodymary or mimosa. All under $25. And that IS a lot of food! I took my boyfriend there, and this boy eats a lot! He was full and couldn't even get to dessert. (Well yea he is a boy and may be not that into sweets, but still).\nThe flavors of the food are really good and satisfying. I truly recommend the chicken dish on the brunch menu, the grilled octopus and the gnocchi (which not being a pasta fan, I savored). I hear the pasta is really good too! \nAlso a great place to take company or out-of-towners too! Worst food in Pittsburgh. That's all. I have been there twice, never my choice, I had tummy ache both times. I think the food is boring. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with non-gourmet food, but Ritter's, is just \"blah\". It also was an unclean feel at times when you are seated and you look around. \nThey are cash only also. That doesn't both me at Pamelas, because the food is oh so delish. Here, you are just wasting you apetite on food that has TONS of rooms for improvement. You cannot go wrong in a Big Burrito restaurant! Well, unless you are  looking for your Mexican friend's grandma's cooking at Mad Mex. Soba is probably my fave BB restaurant (I haven't been to Umi yet). I love creative foods and drinks and Soba delivers here. It's about 17-item small plates list seems extensive, because you would want to try every one of them. We shares six small plates for dinner - grilled octopus, Vietnamese shrimp and squid, yellowtail sashimi, lobster maki, Korean bbq ribs and calamari. The Viet shrimps were quite overcooked - kind of like when you try cooking the chilled cooked shrimps. It's sauce and the accompaniments were amazing though. The ribs were a big hit, crispy, tender and not fatty. I wish the sashimi was a little bigger in portion and the calamari about half the amount they offer. The portions, except for the sashimi were \"Pittsburgh portions\". I almost had to be rolled back home; I was that full, and happy. If I am to spend $100+ on dinner, then I want to be this happy that I would want to write a yelp review the very next morning. Oooooh the lamb shank! My mouth waters just by the thought of it. I have eaten there quite a few times, and their dinner specials are amazing. Usually very reasonably priced under $20 and HUGE portions. Besides, the Girasole salad with chicken is one of my all time favorite salads. IT's also a cozy little place for a friendly dinner. Not one of your romantic restaurants though, because it is small and gets loud. Make reservations ahead. The food here is pretty awesome - simple, elegant (yep I think so) and with great flavor. The sweet crepes are really good, but I usually go there for brunch and although I can have a dessert for a meal, I know I shouldn't and I try to stop myself from doing so. Here at crepes, the savory crepes are so good that, the resistance isn't too difficult. \nIf you are in a protein mood, the breakfast crepe (with sausage, egg and cheese) or the icelandic salmon crepe is a good idea. They are stuffed with the filling, so if you are a petite woman like me, the size is good enough for brunch or lunch. \nThe chocolate-rasperry-whipped cream sweet crepes are out of this world, both white and dark chocolate. Oh, if you like coffee, their cafe au lait is AWESOME! The chocolat chaud (I learned to pronounce chaud today... I took Spanish in school, hello!) is great too. I am not huge on just chocolate, I need something else going on with it, but I like this chaud concoction. \nThe service is pretty solid. I know it can get annoying waiting for a table, but I don't think the servers or management can do much about it. \nIf the weather is bad, usually a good day to visit the Shadyside Crepes.

{"text": "As far as chain restaurants go, Bar Louie is ok. I really like their appetizers and their salads, but I don't care for their burgers or pastas. Their drinks are ok. They're normal corporate restaurant drinks...i.e., Applebees.\n\nService is hit or miss. Last time I went, I had just fine service. The time before that was also just fine. Sometimes the server is a little spazzy and seems new or doesn't know wtf he's talking about. (Once, I went and ordered red zinfandel and he brought me white zinfandel and argued with me that it was red zinfandel. I had to explain to him that white zinfandel can be confusing because it is, in fact, pink. I still don't think he believed me. It would've been amusing if it weren't for the fact that it was actually annoying). \n\nThings I like: calamari, pretzel sticks, wedge salad, some of the sandwiches. Things I dislike: frozen burgers they sell for $1.\n\nGreat to stop in right before a movie at Loews, though! :-) The tuna is so amazing. I am obsessed. The Kim chi side is a bit spicy for my tastes so I get it on the side. The Korean BBQ sauce is so good. A bit sweet and tangy. The tuna is always cooked to perfection and never chewy or fishy. Tastes like a steak. So, in other words, perfect. Worth the price. \n\nThe happy hour is great, too. The drinks never fail. The calamari appetizer is so good. Lightly breaded, right amount of saltiness, and the dipping sauces are wonderful. \n\nI only go on special occasions, but I'll be back! One of my favorite places in shadyside! Such a chill place, and the staff is always so friendly. I love taco Tuesdays. I also love their brunch! Those shadyside skillets are pretty much the best things to have happened to walnut st. \n\nI think what I like most about this place is that the food does not pretend to be anything more than it is. It is food you could easily make yourself at home. It is nothing special, but it's good. It gives you no more and no less than what you need. \n\nI like that their \"fried\" food isn't actually fried. It's probably not healthy, but at least it's not fried!\n\nTheir dinner specials, while they do not really change often, are pretty solid. I always have a delicious meal when I'm there!\n\nLastly, the owner seems incredibly nice. I like supporting this local business! I've been coming in here a lot since Shadyside Saloon closed. I enjoy chill bars where the employees actually get to know you. It reminds me of where I work, where our regulars and the employees actually probably cross the line with how close we get to our regulars. Haha. Of course, I'm kidding.\n\nAnyway, I've seen how busy the place gets on trivia night. I've also seen the place completely dead. I still love to come for breakfast on weekends, but I'm also enjoying the nightcap. It seems a lot of the bar customers are regulars. I like this, too. Conversation is more fun that way.\n\nThe food continues to be good, the drink specials are nice, the drinks are stiff, and I finally found a replacement for Shadyside Saloon. Now if only Cappy's could have a dart board... You guys...oh no, but I think this place was bought out! I walked by and saw a sign about ANOTHER waffle place coming soon. Ugh.\n\nThat being said, yeah, I love this place. I am such a fan of the salmon crepe with creme fraiche. God, so good. I can now say that having been to France, this place is pretty legit!\n\nMy only complaint is that I don't really get very full eating here. And it's kind of pricey for not getting you full.

{"text": "Girls looking for a sugar daddy, guys looking for a cougar, or if you're just a pretentious douche: Bossa Nova is the place for you.\n\nThe atmosphere is downright tragic for how hard it tries.  The bar prices scream to the proletariat: \"Let them drink beer down the street! We only want the bourgeois in here.\"  Even the DJ they had during the Gallery Crawl a few weeks back was tragic.  I mean I know that the DJ has to appease the sugar daddies and cougars but is every place in Pittsburgh required to have 80s music?  I'm sure it is in the liquor license application.\n\nThat said, the barstaff is generally friendly and very quick - most likely so you don't realize you just paid eight dollars for a beer. Harris Grill was long one of my favorite spots to goto just about any night of the week.  However it's changed in recent months and I don't think I will return.\n\nOn a recent Thursday night, my friend and I had possibly the worst waitress ever.  Her name was Amanda and this is my story about her as our waitress.\n\nShe was not present for about 15 minutes after we were sat.  She finally appeared and asked us for our drink order. She disappeared for about 10 minutes before returning.  She served us our drinks then immediately left for another table. It was another 5 to 10 minutes before she came by again, this time taking our order for food.\n\nShe return 5 minutes later with another round of drinks which we don't remember ordering, but we weren't going to complain. We never saw her the rest of the night.\n\nOther waitresses were making their rounds every 5 minutes out on the patio, but ours never appeared once.  I thought she may have died in back in the kitchen or was burned beyond recognition.  I even asked one of the other waitresses out of concern for her safety if she was okay.  She said they would check.  She returned not long after and said she was alright.  I relaxed a little, until another 15 minutes went by... it was now about 30 minutes since we had ordered and no food.\n\nWe waited a bit longer, we still hadn't seen Amanda (our waitress for those paying attention).  An hour went by and we had had enough. I really couldn't believe this.  Not only did we not have our food, but we hadn't seen our waitress in an hour.  An hour.  What the hell? Who deleted my review of Sunnyledge?\n\nBack in April, I met a girl for drinks at the Sunnyledge.  We had both heard good things about the place and that they had a great martini menu.  When we arrived there, however it was a different story.  We were met at the door by the hostess (I presume) who did not take our arrival kindly and seemed annoyed that we were there.\n\nWe shrugged it off and went to the bar.  The bartender was something else and it seemed as if he was on a variety of drugs. He acted as if he was on the last quaaludes in his posession and moved with a subtle grace most often reserved for Miss Universe pageant constestants.  And that's saying something.\n\nThe bartender would disappear for long periods of time, during which we would hear odd sounds coming from the kitchen.  Mostly the sounds of silverware banging around.  It was as if the hostess and bartender were throwing cutlery at each other in attempts to get us to think just what the hell was going on.  We were there for about 2 hours  and during that time saw the bartender a total of 4 times.  Most of the time he was hiding out in the kitchen.  \n\nEven when it came time to get our check, it took about 15 minutes for him to return with my card.\n\nTerrible service that night from an otherwise reputable place.  I have no plans on returning.\n\nI hope this isn't deleted again, and if it is, I will make sure it's well known and will take printed copies of this and put them up around Sunnyledge and use every contact I have to get this printed in the Post Gazette and City Paper.

{"text": "I have mixed feelings about this place. I wish I could give 2.5 stars, but I'm in a good mood so I'm rounding up today. \n\nThis was my first time here and I honestly wasn't sure what to expect. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the layout of the dining area. It seemed less intimate than I had pictured in my mind. The tables were all jammed together and the restaurant had a crowded feel to it. Fortunately, there wasn't a long wait as we had made a reservation. \n\nWe were seated at a table in the middle of the dining room alongside a busy throughway. It seemed all the servers were destined to walk past our table. I appreciated that their menu pointed out that their meals were \"meant to be shared.\" My wife and I decided to share our two meals: Chang's Spicy Chicken and Double Pan Fried Noodles. Before our meal came out our waitress set some sauces on the table in a \"here's your sauce\" kind of way. I remember thinking, \"That's very nice, but I have no idea why you just gave us sauce.\" There was no explanation - just a little tray of sauces. Our food came out and she finally asked if we like mild, medium, or hot sauce. We picked medium and, with a few scoops, she turned our three sauces into three mixed sauces and I still didn't know what they were for. \n\nForget the sauce though, my attention was now drawn to our meal. For meals that were \"meant to be shared\" these sure are little portions. I guess when you go for that high-end presentation you can charge 50% more for 50% less. The food itself was good (in an ok sort of way). I can't say it was the best I've had, but it was good enough. \n\nOverall I thought the experience was lacking. P.F. Chang's tries to be classy, but does it in a cafeteria sort of way. I was constantly distracted by the front doors opening and icy air pouring across the room. The music didn't fit the ambiance. Our table felt like it was in the middle of the road. The restaurant was loud and crowded. The girls at the table next to us were taking those annoying duck-face puckered lip pictures...  \n\nI think our experience may have been different if we were seated at one of the booths along the side of the restaurant, but no such luck. We had another opportunity to eat here today and the experience was much improved. There was no crowd to fight and we weren't seated near the door as we were last time. As I expected, getting a table near the edge of the restaurant provides for a much nicer dining experience. Our service was good and they accommodated our 1 year old nicely. I appreciate that they serve steamed veggies on the kids menu. \n\nI still left with the impression that the serving sizes were small in comparison to most other places, but we were satisfied and happy. I don't get it. Cold cheese and cold pepperoni on my pizza? Why does Pittsburgh have to be so weird? I just got accustomed to fries and coleslaw on my sandwiches but a guy has to draw the line somewhere. And what's with everyone bagging up their extra cheese and taking it home? \n\nMy gut tells me this would be an awesome pizza if only they'd cook it. I will forever remember this drive-through conversation:\n\nWelcome to Wendy's. Can I take your order?\n\nYeah, I'd like a Frescuit. \n\nWe ain't got no hashbrowns!\n\n...um, all I want it a Frescuit. \n\nA'ight...

{"text": "Nobody has reviewed this in a while, but I am surprised at the lack of lovin'!  My husband and I ate here a few nights ago and we liked it a lot.\n\nWe started with drinks--he got the house-brewed Portland Wheat and said it was quite a good beer, and I got a mixed drink (Red Rock) that was also tasty.  \n\nHe got a burger covered in mozzarella cheese and I got a mahi sandwich.  Both great--the fries and side salads are good here too, and there is no skimping on portions of anything.  There were tons of things on the menu that I'm looking forward to trying.\n\nWe are usually not dessert people at all but ended the meal sharing a triple chocolate stout cheesecake--who can resist a beer cheesecake, come on!\n\nOur food and service was great.  They had the Penguins game on all the TVs in the bar and were setting up live music for after the game.  Seriously, what's not to like!?  I'm thinking this place has changed for the better since the last review a year ago... :) Ordered the lunch special with sesame bean curd + steamed rice + veggie egg roll.  The food was great, and you get a LOT for $5.65.  My friend got general tso's chicken with fried rice, and she enjoyed her meal as well.\n\nThe lady at the counter was very friendly and refilled our waters often during lunch.  When we were done eating, she gave us little Japanese mango gummy candies on our way at the door.\n\nI would definitely come back for lunch here--it's nothing fancy, but very reasonably priced and, well, tasty. :) My husband made us reservations here to celebrate our 5th anniversary and I am confident in saying that it was the best meal I've had in Pittsburgh.  The atmosphere is warm and cozy and not stuffy at all, which is not often the case with \"fine dining.\"  I appreciated the home-like feeling and the framed Pens jerseys on the wall! I am becoming a Yinzer...\n\nThe bread and holy oil, chickpea dish, and goat cheese spread that they set the table with was amazingly good, and it only gets better.  All their meals come with a salad and a pasta dish with vodka sauce.  (I didn't see anything about fettucine in a cheese wheel, so maybe they don't do that anymore--not sure.)\n\nI ordered seafood diavolo but could only finish about 1/3 of it, and my husband ordered a steak dish that he (amazingly) polished off.  He said it was the best steak he's had since we left Nebraska, so that's a pretty high compliment.\n\nYes, this place is expensive ($50-ish/entree), but you can DEFINITELY get at least two meals from one, and there is an option to share a dinner with a $15 charge for the extra pasta and salad dish, which may be the route I would take in the future since I'm a snacker and would rather have an appetizer as dinner anyway.\n\nI think everyone in the 'burgh should try this place at least once, for a special occasion dinner because it's awesome! Good: Mexican groceries in Pittsburgh\nBetter: The chipotle tomatillo salsa, homemade by Edgar.\nBest. The taco stand.  Seriously, if you're here, get a damn taco. My husband and I ate lunch here--actually, it was our first meal in our new home of Pittsburgh.\n\nI really expected it to be better than it was.  It was cheap, fast, and the service was good but the food just didn't wow me.  There was nothing WRONG with it, but it was just middle-of-the-road americanized Chinese lunch special.  (Which I suppose I can't complain about, since I knew that when I ordered it.)\n\nThat being said, this Chinese place has an amazing vegetarian selection!  I'm not just saying that because I moved from Omaha, beef capital of the universe.  I ordered General Tso's tofu for lunch--and I could have ordered General Tso's soy protein!  Ha!\n\nI would come back here, maybe, if I was looking for a quick bite in Shadyside.

It was so bad and we had waited a ridiculous amount of time (c'mon, Steak N Shake is basically a glorified McD's), our waiter comped our WHOLE MEAL.\n\nIf not for the compensation, I would have been pissed that we had to pay for such a crappy meal. The bf, on the other hand, was more upset about the principle of the matter... we had trekked all that way just to get our Steak N Shake fix (since both of us haven't had it since our undergraduate days) and it was a major fail.\n\nI think I'm good with my Steak N Shake craving for a long time now...\n\n\n\nPS. The whole joint smells like major B.O. I found a short black curly hair in my basket of fries... and it was definitely not mine.\n\nNeedless to say, this completely ruined my meal.

Tram's Kitchen was closed, so my girlfriend and I went up the street to Pho Minh instead. \n\nHere are my gripes:\n- Food was WAY too salty (ie. we were both bloated like hell the next day)\n- Restaurant was WAY too quiet (they need to turn on the radio or something!)\n- Service was slow (or they often forgot simple requests like water, etc.)\n\nI will credit them for their spring rolls though... and the sweet little man who runs the cash register!

A complete travesty to Chinese cuisine. It was bland, yet greasy and MSG-ridden (if that makes any sense). Not only that, they also didn't have BEEF CHOW FUN (ok, so whoever claims this restaurant serves \"authentic\" Chinese food clearly has no clue on what they're talking about). And the kicker? It came out to about $32 + tip for food that we DIDN'T even finish half of.

{"text": "I normally love this chain restaurant, but this wasn't a good experience.  We arrived on a Saturday afternoon and there were plenty of empty tables.   Our server was very perky and took our drink orders.   \n\nOne of the reasons we picked here is because they have a nice gluten free menu.  We ordered appetizers, soup and entrees.  Our soup arrived first which just irks me.   Appetizers first please!!!!!!     The wonton soup was good, a bit different than most since it contained several shrimp and water chestnuts. We then waited a long time for our dumplings.  They were presented by a kitchen staff and looked beautiful but they didn't bring plates and he dashed away before we could stop him.  Although our server had stopped by too many times before this, she was now nowhere in sight.  We just ate them off the serving plate. Good, not great.  Not really hot, especially after waiting all that time.  The server did come by at some point to apologize for the delay and explained that's why she brought soup first.\n\nThe manager and the server continued to keep dropping by to the point of annoyance.   We waited forever for our food which was crazy since there were few patrons.  \n\nOur entrees came, again with no plates. We caught him this time and he slowly brought back 3 plates.   The bottom one was dirty and nobody in sight again. I got up and went to a serving station where a different server was standing and asked for a clean plate. He reached under the counter, pulled out a plate and then picked a white cloth up off the counter, wiped the plate and gave it to me.  I stated I didn't want a plate he had just wiped with a cloth laying on the counter and he stated it was how they cleaned their plates.   WHAT????????\n\nI went back to the table and used a small bread plate for my meal.  I was truly disgusted.  The server stopped by and my husband started to tell her our situation but I stopped him since we had spent soooooooo much time talking with this server that I didn't want to prolong this anymore.  \n\nAs far as food goes, the gluten free Mongolian beef was good.  The lemon chicken was tough and too thick.  The fried rice had no eggs and wasn't hot.  Overall, not a great experience. I will start out by saying that for the most part, our meals were very good, but they were overshadowed by a lousy server.   We waited forever for a drink order and then even longer just to place our order.\n\nMy husband ordered the French onion soup, which is a favorite for both of us.   I can say without a doubt that it was the worst we have ever eaten.   Visually, it looked appealing, with lots of cheese and crunchy onions on top, but once you pulled the cheese back, it was a bowlful of bread cubes soaked in broth.   There was absolutely no broth to speak of, so it was like eating mushy bread.   He ate a few spoonfuls and that was it.   We should have complained, but thought the server should have noticed that it wasn't eaten and asked about it.   Unfortunately she brought his salad at the same time, so he had plates all around him.  I had the wedding soup which was excellent.  Loaded with all the typical wedding soup ingredients, and thick and tasty.\n\nMy husband had the pork chops, which were tender and juicy.  My Mom had a chicken dish, smothered in onions and gravy which she liked.   They both had plenty of leftovers.   The winner was my veal martini.  Veal slices, lightly breaded and fried, with a two cheese sauce which was excellent.   We all had the twice baked potatoes which were just OK.\n\nOur server never checked on us, never offered drink re-fills, and overall it was frustrating.", "user_id": "DJS0o7mFgw55SnA2JwNrbg", "business_id": "JDDeaNfb0JXD1NbznSIC9g"}

Food was served efficiently for large groups, and arrived at the correct temperature. They have a great wine list, and overall offer a comfortable space with delicious food and drinks. Try the lamb loin, chicken, and cioppino - my three current favorites. Their pork chops are the specialty of the house, I'm told.\n\nWill definitely be back. Delicious pizza. Amazing beer selection. We don't live anywhere close to this place, and will drive 45+ minutes for their food and ambience. Whenever I have family visiting, and we have the time, we trek over for a delicious dinner at Bado's. Be sure to check out their chalkboard with the drink and food specials!\n\nWe've never had any problems with the service or the food, and will definitely be back! I would give this place 6 stars if that were an option. I have been going to Tram's for the past 3 years, and love the place. Not sure how the people who have given it negative reviews could arrive at their conclusions, but hey, everyone's entitled to his/her opinion, right?\n\nEverything I have ever ordered here has come fast and fresh. Spring Rolls are a must, and can be made a meal unto themselves. Chicken fried rice is astounding. Vermicelli dishes are a great treat in the warmer months (because they come at a cool temperature, and are almost salad-like), and the chicken pho is transcendent.\n\nYes, transcendent.\n\nI yearn for the cold months because it means that I can eat the stuff - my wife at first was horrified that I referred to chicken pho as the best broth based food I had ever eaten. Hell, she even made fun of me for craving 'chicken soup,' which most people would simply make at home, but this is not like anything at home, this is the ultimate comfort dish. The beef pho is good, but their chicken version is simply the best.\n\nI know that they had some problems with their accreditation, but that appears to be well in their past, and frankly, I never had a single problem with their food before that. (That's more than I can say for many other restaurants I've been to...) Really, really tasty food here. We like to try out new places all the time, but had never been here before - we have tried \"the competition\" nearby, and liked it a lot.\n\nToday, we wanted to see why this restaurant always looks like it's packed. Now we know. The service was impeccable, and we thought the restaurant was spotlessly clean. The food was spot on - from the shumai (tastes like it's made from scratch) to the Taipei Special Dumplings (which have a tasty thin exterior and a rich, savory pork filling), we enjoyed our appetizers very much.\n\nThe main dishes were equally as nice - we had the crispy shrimp and broccoli (lightly battered crispy shrimp and a great sweet chili garlic sauce) and at our waiter's suggestion, the basil rice noodles with chicken. I must say that the basil rice noodle dish was the best of the day; flavorful thin chicken slices with fresh basil tossed in with the delicious noodles and a little bit of sauce. The dish just works... Like other Chinese restaurants, the portions are large, and we probably should have only ordered one entree for the two of us after enjoying the two appetizers. Food was served at the correct temperature, too, which is something I always look for. (I hate it when food is too hot or too cold when it is served!)\n\nThere is room for improvement with regards to the actual menu - it's too big, and has too many items on too many pages, making it a bit difficult to make up ones' mind, but this is hardly unique to Taipei, and I would say 99% of Chinese restaurants have this problem...\n\nPrices are reasonable, and overall, it was a nice Saturday lunch experience.\n\nWill definitely be back.", "user_id": "x1tqIO9G1RX3qd6Y4TsHXg", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}
{"text": "Have I mention I LOVE the Big Burrito group? All I did was confirm that I still wanted to be subscribed to their email list and they sent me a free lunch entree for responding. I decided to use this coupon to try one of their restaurants that I haven't yet.\nYUM. I decided to go with the Piccola Gusta option, so that I could try a bit of everything. I went with the arugula salad, gnocchi and sword fish sandwich. It was all outstanding.\nUnfortunately there was a large dark hair in my salad that I noticed immediately (thank goodness) and our waiter took care of it promptly. A lot of times I would let that ruin my experience but I tried very hard to not let it. Anyway, finished the meal with the carrot gob. Again, yum!!\nOur service after that was just okay. He seemed to kind of forget about us? It was a bit odd. At one point we had no forks for a while with entrees in front of us. I guess I always expect something a little more as far as service when something like a hair accident happens.\nThe food makes this place hands down as long as there isn't hair in it! We sat in the covered indoor porch area which was cute for lunch, but honestly seemed as though they segregated people by their appearance in who sat inside when going in to use the restroom. \nOnce they work on their service Casbah could easily be 5 stars. Maybe next time! I love, love, love their pad thai! My boyfriend had bi bam bap which he loved as well. We shared the tuna tartar for an appetizer then finished with the chocolate pretzel stack! All in all, it was a delicious meal which is why I give it 4 stars. \n\nThe service was good, but nothing out of this world. \n\nUnfortunately due to its ambiance and set up, our table was next to an obnoxiously loud table which caused us to not hang out and drink anymore cocktails. A little more space between tables would be nice, but it's not stoping me from going back.\n\nWell done, Big Burrito! I really want to like Harris Grill more, but there is always something that turns me off. It's in a great location, with a lot of outdoor seating.\nTheir food is good. They have a hilarious menu, with descriptions written to make you laugh!The pirogies are so good and I've gotten a ton of different sandwiches and salads here that were pleasing.\nIt gets busy here with their lower costs items and drink specials pulling out the college crowd. So be prepared to deal with that some nights.\nWhat turns me off a bit, it always seems dirty. I wish it had more of a cleanly feel so I could get into eating here more. The bathroom smells, the menus seem filthy, but I like the food! \nPretty much, it puts me in a tough place because if the rooms are dirty, what does the kitchen look like. I still come back when friends want to go, but I'm never running back. \nClean it up Harris Grill and I'll be back! Better than Subway, but not Jimmy Johns. And who doesn't accept debit or credit cards this day in age? I'll make my sandwich at home. We were so excited to try this after all the hype. When moving everyone kept saying, you will love Tai Pei!\nLast night we ordered take out and it left us disappointed. My fianc\u00e9 got the amazing chicken and I got sesame chicken. We also ordered crab ragoons. Both of our chicken meals left us wanting something more as far as flavor. Mine needed a bit more sauce to make not as dry. But, our crab ragoons were fantastic. \nI can't say much for service since this was take out, but the portion sizes are huge. This makes the prices a bit more bearable because you're getting a lunch and dinner out of the meal. I'm just not that excited for my lunch. There's not much left to say. Maybe we will go back to try the sushi? We will see!", "user_id": "LZlxj3maqbECm5ENroXmFw", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}
{"text": "My mother and I like to brunch here. Admittedly, I'm not a huge antipasti fan, but I still manage to find amazing things that I love. And then I always go with the cannelloni or pollo panini. She always goes with a pasta - gnocchi or pollo limone. You really can't go wrong. It's bright, cheery and warm inside the building - makes for a lovely Sunday brunch. \n\nMy brothers, younger than me with basic American taste buds, hate it here - far too traditional for them. So, I suppose it's very palate based. Maybe not the best restaurant for children. I went on a first date here Friday evening.  It's such a strange mix of upscale and casual diner - that works perfectly. I had the regular cheeseburger and it was absolutely amazing (although messy - so probably not the best first date food). My date had the steak sandwich - he said it was delicious, but it's literally a steak on a bun, so it's hard to eat gracefully (maybe cut it up first?). We had home fries as our sides - I don't even really like home fries, but these were so yummy. Great food all around.\n\nOur food came out lightning fast. We didn't even think it was ours because it was literally five minutes after we ordered. And the service was amazing: so friendly, attentive and efficient. The hostess is the cutest little woman as well. So helpful and sweet. Not to mention, it's so affordable. I was very happy we came across this place.\n\nMy only complaint is that the dining tables in the back are very, very, very close together when they are all split into two-person tables. We were having awkward first date conversations and the couples around us may as well have been at our table. I did not enjoy that. Aside from that, I  had a great experience and I will definitely be back again. First off, and I'm sorry, but Pleasure Bar is the most ridiculous and stupid name for a restaurant ever. It sounds like it should be a seedy, crude night club - and it makes it even more absurd when you walk in and find out this is an old school, old man bar with grandma's Italian dining room in the back (ruffles and floral fruit curtains included).\n\nAside from that (and it's a significant that) - the service was great. The food was warm and filling and homestyle just like we hoped for. A friend and I split the stuffed mushrooms appetizer, so yummy. And our salads (no iceberg - yay!) and dinners were just as good. I'm glad we checked it out. Basic Italian family dinner status, if that's what you're looking for.\n\nBut can i mention again how ill-fitting \"Pleasure Bar\" is. This is a magical wonderland of lights, alcohol, cheer and karaoke connoisseurs. The building most likely shines from space with the amount of lights on the outside. Inside, no less lights, but just add popcorn strings, wrapped beams, bows, bells, ornaments, santa paintings and people dressed as santa. We sat at the cramped bar in awe with giddy smiles on our faces for most of the night. Just try to avoid Nick at Night - he'll try to take you to Vegas and marry you the same night, or pawn you off to his undertaker friend. Aside from some creepy lovebirds, it's cheap, everyone is extra friendly and there were even a bunch of Christmas tunes thrown in to the karaoke.  Everyone should go here at least once. It's just so festive! I was so happy!", "user_id": "0Qsw23EuRNlrvRVGI9JG5Q", "business_id": "XmdTkxKyJd7TuDLoiic1kg"}
{"text": "This is a Pizza Hut/Wing Street. i hate to review chains unless something really stands out, but i figure there should be at least one review saying it's not a shit hole. \n\nPizza Hut is an old family favorite, surprisingly for their spaghetti, so with my mom in town we tried the local Belmont location. Some locations have different bread sticks then i am used to, but this one had the delicious, garlic covered ones. Spaghetti with meat sauce was good as expected with excellent garlic bread. \n\nIt seems like a smaller dining room, i'm not sure what was around the one wall, may have been more seating. Service was friendly enough, no complaints. They claim to have some of the best burgers in town and surprisingly it was actually a pretty good burger. i ordered the cheeseburger with chili (i was told chili made in house) and mustard combo that comes with fries and a drink for like $6. The fries were blah crinkle cut fries which were fine and the ice for the drink cup came from a cooler of ice on the counter which seemed odd. \n\nIt's kind of a dingy space next door to an independent pharmacy that they've attempted to give some life with a mural on one wall and some local Belmont stuff on another wall. \n\nOverall, i was a satisfied customer. i haven't stepped foot inside yet, but we picked up some food last week. The warm sandwich i got was pretty good (a greasy goodness) and the fries were just plain regular crinkle fries which would have been fine had we been given ketchup. \n\ni was satisfied enough to want to try it again sometime This time i dined in. \nThey have a big menu on the wall and when i finally made up my mind, placed my order. Staff wasn't rude, but didn't give me that thanks for coming feeling. \n\nWasn't too thrilled with my choice this time, i thought it was the same thing i ordered last time, which i still can't remember the name...hot sandwich, beef, mushrooms, etc. i don't think i'll get that again, but i'm convinced that i will find something i really like there. The food never thrills me but entices me enough to try again. Fries were good with ketchup as predicted. \n\nHighlight: there is a picture of Macho Man Randy Savage on the wall around the corner. It is your standard-issue Chinese joint complete with the same menu, food pictures, employees with the minimum English clarity that you find at all of these places.\n\nFor the first time since moving to the Belmont area, i craved some Chinese. i had noticed this little Chinese joint next to the Papa Johns in the Bi-Lo shopping strip and we decided to give it a try. \n\nWe were waiting for a car to get done with an oil change so we opted to eat inside this little place. Had we gotten takeout, it may have been 3 stars because the food wasn't too shabby. Pretty standard General Tso chicken, although the broccoli was as cold as the seating area which required us to wear our jackets. \n\nSurprisingly they didn't overcharge for a canned beverage and they did have a self-serve tea station. \n\nWhile we were eating, we heard one of the cooks make the most obscene throat clearing noise that you usually only hear in the movies. It sounded like he was struggling to bring up a major loogie that was trapped deep within his soul. Fortunately we already had our food. \n\nIf you're desperate for Chinese, get it to go.", "user_id": "zHfA7hsEDI2TbPJ-nDD-QQ", "business_id": "HPcrrz8uipPQyK-5zd6w9Q"}
{"text": "Take out - No dine in - Friendly staff - Very good Pizza, better than most!  Fast, fast, fast service, great quality, great taste!  Ate here (in there parking lot) Sunday night!\n\nI'm almost sure the Cheese they use is 100% Mozzarella (instead of a blend) I am a Fan of this Pizza with EASE!  If they were located closer to me I would be getting more Pizza from them vs Fuel! This is probably close to what most people expect for German food.  My expectations are high and I am a hypocrite for sure in almost everything!  With that understood...  read on:  The Pretzel Roll was very good (4.75 stars),  The kinda cubed and Fried Potatoes cooked with Bacon (called fries) ROCKED (5 yelp stars)!!! The service was very good, very team oriented.   Though I was pointing at what I wanted on the menu it took my server four guesses to get what I wanted.   It was impressive to me that he made sure!   Two waiters and a manager helped serve my table (I'm always impressed by a great team) so the service gets 4.9 yelp stars!\n\nWhen I go German I want BRATS!!!  So I had the Two Brat Lunch Platter (may be called something else) with Sour Kraut and a side of Red Cabbage!  One of the Brats was Good as in Maybe 3.5 yelp stars which means I would not get it again!  The other Brat was OK maybe 2.5 (I'm thinking that is generous though).  The gravy with the Brats was good and the mustard was very good and spicy.  Goulash (not spelled as they did) was in a thick \"hunteresk\" type of homey (not the clown) gravy.  I took several small tastes to get the vegetables and meat and hesitate to give it a 2.25 yelp stars because I bet this is the flavor many people want!  Warm Sour Kraut was fresh (not canned) and was A-OK (3 yelp stars)  Warm Red Cabbage same story different flavor (less than three stars though).\n\nFor Dessert I should have gone somewhere else (and I did after I had it here).  The lady (maybe Manager/Owner? I'm guessing?) described the Black Forest Cake as being \"lite\" !  When dinning out or in or anywhere \"lite\" is usually (not always) NOT how I want most Desserts described!  Usually I want to hear:  Rich, sweet, creamy, Chocolaty, H E A V Y !  !   !  Calorie Laden and FULL of flavor!  Calories!  It's Friday, can't I be bad as I want to be one day (worse than I say I am too much of the time).  As my servers could tell I was not a small fan of the Black Forrest Cake - Not a small fan, not a fan at all!\n\nHerman the German was right!  Though I had to find out for my self!  I would go back now that I know some of what I do like and some of what I do not...  There were some other menu items I would check out! This is one of those places I really want to LOVE for some reason!  So I was glad to go back for lunch today and get the items I liked last time and taste something new.  The service was very good last time, today it was even better.  My choice today was the \"International Hoagie\" This was very Good an easy 4 yelp stars of: Roast Beef, Westphalian Ham, Salami, Turkey, Fleischkaese, Swiss Cheese, Lettuce and Tomato on a fantastic Pretzel Hoagie Roll.  This usually is served with Tarragon-Balsamic Mayonnaise, which I asked them to leave off.  The only other change I asked was to add onions.  This sandwich was very good!  French Fries were offered with this sandwich though I substituted the delicious \"Home Fries\" cooked with bits of Bacon...5 yelp stars Yum!  For Dessert I had \"Schokoladenmus\" Chocolate Mousse served with Bourbon Sauce and Fresh Fruit, it was A-OK 3 yelp stars.  The next course was five Pretzel Rolls looking great on a plate (see photos of all this if you like).  The next course, was a course of action to pay and get out before i ordered more food!  Oktoberfest here starts Friday September 23 and is for the weekends only (four weekends Fridays and Saturdays).\n\nNext time I'll be there for dinner and eat outside.", "user_id": "PpkKVodWC0sdn74TbHQLzA", "business_id": "qYuSoVBS_1i_btLzFefDeg"}
{"text": "Our office recently placed an order from TLC Wings & Grill.  While they have a huge selection of wings and sauces,  I wasn't really in the mood for chicken wings.  Instead, I opted for the Chicken Parmesan sub ($5.29) with a side order of fries ($1.89).\n\nThe chicken parm sub wasn't the smartest  choice for a take-out -- by the time the food arrived, the sauce had sort of soaked into the bread and made it a bit squishy. \n\nHowever, the flavor was very good and the portion size was huge (thankfully it was already cut in 2 - definitely enough for 2 meals!)  The fries were good, and they were very generous with the portion size of that as well. \n\nI would definitely order this again, but probably not for take-out.   I would also recommend giving these guys a try if you are looking for good quality wings & fries at reasonable prices. Went back to the Waldhorn this past Sunday for brunch and had a great visit. Normally, I avoid buffets, but their brunch buffet is nice. I love the cooked-to-order omelette station as well as the selection of  traditional breakfast foods and traditional German foods.  The people are friendly, service was good and quality of the food is excellent.  I would definitely recommend giving them a try for brunch even if you are not typically a fan of \"German\" food -- I don't eat beef, pork, cabbage, etc but I can certainly find plenty of other options here that are excellent (Sp\u00e4tzle, Chicken, French Toast, Cheese Grits, Home Fries, Fresh Vegetables, Fresh Soup of the day, and delish fresh breads).  Brunch is also an excellent time to try some of their various desserts  such as fruit cobblers,  Napoleons, Bienenstich Kuchen (Honey cake with cream in the middle and honeyed almonds on top),  Black Forest Cake, Apfelstrudel, Eclairs, and many others. This review is just for Oktoberfest in the tent- not for dining in the restaurant. In years past, we have eaten indoors first and then headed out to the tents for the music and festivities.  (You might want to do this if you prefer a quieter meal with better selection of foods.)  But this year, we just went for the tent. \n\nIf you are planning to go to Oktoberfest at Waldhorn be prepared to wait in line...at least 3 or 4 times before you can begin to really enjoy yourself. \n\nFirst, you wait in line to show your i.d. & pay the cover charge which currently is $3. Then, once you get your wristband and proceed to the tent, you will have to wait in line to buy tickets.  \n\nI really don't care for the way they do the tickets -- you have to buy tickets for specific things.  For example, you buy tickets for single beers or pitchers of beer... you buy a ticket for a pretzel or sp\u00e4tzle or apfelstrudel... and they print out the ticket with the name of the item on it.  \n\nI am guessing that they do it to track how much of each item sells, but it seems like an inefficient system  to me.\n\nIt helps to check out their website for the tent menu before you go so that you will know how much cash to take (no debit or credit cards or checks in the tent - it is cash only).\n\nhttp://www.waldhorn.us/tent_menu.htm\n\nOnce you have purchased the tickets, you then have to line up again to get food and drinks. \n\nSince I don't eat pork or beef, I ate a lite dinner before heading out to the Waldhorn. However, I definitely saved room for some sp\u00e4tzle & a pretzel -yummy!\n\nWhen I first started going to the 'fest several years ago, it was not nearly as crowded as it is now.  However, the word has definitely gotten out and they are packing them in these days! \n\nIt gets really loud in the tent with all the people talking and the band playing traditional German folk music.  There is also a small stage set up in front of the band, so get ready to do the chicken dance.  Don't worry, no matter what time you go out, you'll have a chance to do it.  (I think they played it at least 5  times over the course of the evening). \n\nOf course, parking when you arrive can be a challenge, but if the parking lots are already full when you arrive, you can park next door at the James K Polk memorial or just around the corner at the furniture stores on Carolina Place parkway. \n\nAll in all, despite the weird ticketing system, the lines, and challenges in finding a place to sit, it can still be a lot of fun!

{"text": "I love these wings!!!\n\nThere are so many flavors here....and I've enjoyed a lot of them...like, Hot, Barbecue, Cajun, Lemon Pepper and Spicy Garlic Parmesan and I have not been disappointed yet! \n\nEach wing is juicy and full of flavor, they are always hot and made to order ..SOOOO amazing! \n\nYes...they have more than just wings....like pizza, subs and fries...but I've only had the wings AND trust me YOU are going to want to try these wings...again and again!!!\n\nIn my opinion, these are the best wings in town! We had a wonderful time!\n\n We were seated right away and our waiter Jay was friendly and very helpful. We all decided to have the Endless Shrimp. Endless amounts of several different types of shrimp with either a house or Cesar salad and those delicious biscuits!!!! Yummy!\n\nMy favorite type was the Parmesan Shrimp. They were very similar to the shrimp scampi, which is another personal favorite but with a delicious cheesy breading....then they are baked again and come out hot and overflowing with cheese. Soooo good!\n\nHowever, all the other options were great too. We also enjoyed the shrimp pasta which was full of flavor, the fried shrimp that were crispy and the glaze on the Teriyaki Grilled Shrimp was so tasty! \n\nOur food came out hot and it was really endless....we were stuffed and happy when we left so overall that means it was a great meal and I look forward to going back! Well done Jason's Deli, well done! \n\nStopped in for lunch today, and it actually was busy inside but not overwhelming! I was able to order right away and decided to attempt to get a \"healthy\" lunch so I ordered the Ranchero Chicken Wrap to go...it comes with in an organic wheat wrap and blue chips and salsa...so in my book that's healthy enough for me! \n\nBUT...what made the trip so awesome was that while I was waiting for them to prepare my wrap the manager came out from behind the counter and said it wouldn't be a long  but to help myself to an ice cream cone while I waited....can you say WINNING!!! \n\nBut now on to the wrap...\n\nWhen I first unwrapped it, I wasn't very impressed with how it looked but once I tasted it all those thoughts were pushed aside. The wrap comes in a wheat wrap with grilled chicken breast, cheddar cheese ,jalape\u00f1os, pico de gallo, some southwest spices and ranch dressing. The  jalape\u00f1os added a nice little kick, but they weren't overpowering. I couldn't really taste the southwest spices perhaps they were overpowered by the ranch dressing but unlike most people I'm a fan of ranch dressing ( I know it's a lot of calories but its so delicious I digress) \n\nThe blue chips were good but the salsa was delicious! It tasted VERY fresh. It was so good, I added some of the my wrap....YUMMY!\n\nOverall, I was very impressed....enjoyed my lunch and the ice cream cone....will I be back....of course! It was my co-workers choice to pick out our lunch spot and she had a craving for some fried fish and since our options were limited she chose Captain D's!\n\nWe walked in and the place was pretty empty. The cashier greeted us and took order right away!  We found a table and waited and waited...finally our food arrived and I realized the wait was for them cooking it up right then! Yesss!!!\n\nI chose the fish tenders and fries combo. I've had it before, but it was much better this time since it was nice and hot!\n\n I was a little disappointed in two things from my visit, first the fries were cold! If you took the time to make the fish why not the fries??? And they charged me $.10 for a cup of water?!? Really??? \n\nBut I mean overall, I left full and the food was pretty good.

{"text": "Mama Mia that's some good cheese......\n\nStopped by the mall on the way home the other night, and somehow ended up at the end of the parking lot in a dead end right in front of Buca Di Beppo.  Not sure what drove me into this location tonight, as I have only heard of the GINORMOUS portion sizes, and we were in the mood for something very light, and did not want anything real heavy. I know, this is Italian and everything is heavy, but we decided to give them a try since the parking lot was not nearly as full as normal.  (That could be good, or that could be bad) Anyhooo...we felt like an adventure none the less.\n\nSince this was our true \"first visit\" we felt in order to take the tour....through the maze, into the kitchen, (hey look someone is actually eating in the kitchen) and onto the myriad of other rooms, finally locating our table in a room, with just one other \"festive\" couple.  Apparently a few servers had been cut, so there were a few questions as to who actually had our table.  One would think that was bad, however we did have at least three servers attend to our needs at the very beginning.\n\nOf course, by now, you know I drink water, and my better have always has sweet tea. The drinks were quickly presented and we placed our very huge order of just the Mozzarella Cheese.  We had the complimentary basket of bread, with Olive Oil / Balsamic Vinegar, to help soak up the very tasty Marinara Sauce left over from the Cheese Sticks.\n\nThe portion sizes were reasonable for the price, and as expected, it was enough to feed both of us, especially the 2 sections of bread.\n\nThis will be on the list for us to visit later on, we when are hungry.\n\nService was fast and friendly.\n\n NCFoodGuy This is based on my last visit , as I had almost given up on Longhorn after a previous BAD experience since the new renovations and menu change.\n\nFor starter's if you have NOT been to longhorn within the last year, they have a whole new menu, the prices have increased, and there is no more value menu.\n\nWe usually do call ahead seating when eating out, but this time we opted for \"let's just see how busy they are\", because if it was anything like our last visit the place should be empty.  Upon entering the door, the wait was approx 20 min, but I spoke to the host, and while it was just two of us, we opted for any seats that were available.  We were immediately sat, and we were seated right next to the kitchen. (Usually this is the worst seat in any restaurant).  \n\nWe were greeted by our server, \"Chuck\" he was very friendly, and promptly took our drink order.  The bread was quickly brought to the table which was still very warm, and the butter melted with ease. At this time I looked over the menu, and opted for the (limited time only special ) Rainbow Trout w/ Shrimp / Lobster Filling w/ Rice Pilaf and House Salad.  I have added a photo of the meal.\n\nMy wife had the Filet Mignon, with steamed vegetables and a house salad.  It was cooked perfectly, and the vegetables were awesome.  We were very pleasantly surprised.\n\nMy meal with the trout was excellent, and I was very excited that this location finally put GOOD SERVICE, and a GOOD MEAL together at the same time.\n\nAfter this visit, I give them a four, because the server, who was stationed right beside us (at the kitchen door) was right on top of the service, with drinks, and with removing the dishes as they were emptied.\n\nWe skipped on the dessert this time, as we were very full from our meal.  but we what saw pass by us, looked very enticing.\n\nI am all about second chances, and this was a redeeming factor for this location.\n\nKudos to the management, and to our wonderful server \"Chuck\".\n\nWe will be back, and would recommend giving these folks a try.\n\nBest Regards,\nNCFoodGuy", "user_id": "3eY9tFgtCwCu6iRy6NZLHQ", "business_id": "SVKC_-gIQFkHElZ6bFsE6g"}
{"text": "I wouldn't be so quick to hand out only one star, but after much consideration, I can't give this place any more. My wife and I went on a Thursday night. The place was less than half full, yet the hostess had us wait between 5-10 minutes for them to clean a table before seating us. Seems kind of asinine when there are plenty of empty seats throughout the restaurant. I understand that due to staffing they may have wanted to sit us in a particular server's section, but I believe customer service is all about perception. Our waitress did not seem very enthusiastic.\n\nThe food was a mixed bag. My wife enjoyed her LongHorn Salmon, but my Renegade Top Sirloin was ruined by being served completely drenched in oil. I've eaten at Longhorn in Maine a couple of times, and don't remember their steaks being served this way. If this is normal here, then I much prefer the steaks at Texas Roadhouse for this price range. My lobster tail was good, and not overcooked. For dessert, my wife and I shared a Caramel Apple Goldrush. This was most excellent, and almost warranted an extra star.\n\nThe main reason for the one star is what happened after our visit. I had left a $10 cash tip, and filled out the credit card slip to reflect this. A few days later, when the charge showed up on my credit card statement, I found that an additional $10 had been added. I immediately went back to the restaurant and spoke very cordially with a manager, showing him the receipt for my visit and my credit card statement. Everyone makes mistakes, but it's how a business handles a customer after a mistake is made that sets the tone for future business. The first thing he did, after researching the error in the back, is offer a $10 coupon. That is not acceptable to me, because to take advantage of this, I'd have to eat here again. He asked me what he should do (isn't HE the manager?), and I suggested that he credit the overcharge back to my card, or void/refund the full amount, and recharge it. I was told that I'd have to fill out a form that would have to be faxed to corporate, then I'd have to wait an unknown number of days to see the amount credited back to my card. I understand that there may be corporate policies that he has to follow, but there seemed to be very little compassion or empathy on his part. He should have still offered the coupon or maybe a comp'd entr\u00e9e for the trouble of driving all the way back to the store because of a pretty significant error one of their employees made. No such luck. I would not have necessarily accepted the offer, but the gesture would definitely be appreciated and goes a long way towards a customers' perceptions about how important they are to a business. I do have a background in customer service management, and this would have never flown under my watch.\n\nMy wife and I have never been disappointed at Texas Roadhouse in Matthews, where the staff has always been enthusiastic and the food is exactly what we expect at this style of restaurant. I guess we'll stick with that when we're in the mood for a slab of beef and all the fixin's. The restaurant and corporate did follow up with me. They sent a letter of apology, refunded the overcharge, and gave us a decent gift card to give them another chance. My wife and I were hesitant to use the gift card at this location, but that's what we ended up doing. That visit was definitely better than the previous one. For the response to my complaint, I thank the management and corporate office for their sincere concern and willingness to make the situation better. They did all this within a month of that first fateful visit. I know this was a year ago, but I thought it would only be fair to them to post a follow-up to my scathing review.\n\nBased on the second visit, it may not be the best steak house in the area, but we would go back again if we hadn't moved out of the area.", "user_id": "ENS1KuyheWHgH2Q3oBSwvA", "business_id": "AUDuCSWYzzRP3H2w7TxtuQ"}
{"text": "this is just high priced captain D's. they quality has gone downhill over the past decade now I remember WHY I don't eat here. 9/7/2014 Went here for late lunch with a friend after running errands near the mall. I've been here at this location a few times before with great results. Today not so much. Our server Jeff was the worst waitstaff I've encountered in many years.\n\ncould never find him, and when we did was having conversation with other female employee. had to get up and find my own pepper mill that had something in it. had to ask the hostess several times for assistance. \n\n15 minutes after order our salads come, I needed more dressing so we had to search him out in the place because we couldn't see him anywhere fro over 5 minutes. \nafter 45 MORE minutes our meals came. \n\nI ordered the parmesan crusted ribeye, med rare and the French onion soup. she ordered the ribeye as well and I don't remember what side. \n\nmy steak was cool (not cold) and over done to a medium ALSO the cheese on my soup had solidified! so this tells me that our meals SAT in the back so long they got cold. my friends meal was also cool - all of it!\n\nShe said NOTHING but by now I am pissed off, the guy never refilled our drinks - we had to ask for others to get it and by the time he remembered we had probably needed a refill we were already done drinking half of what the last person we begged for liquid from gave us. \n\nI told the hostess that this guy needs a lot more training because he is the worse server I have ever come across, I FIRED servers who weren't this bad when I was a head waitress for 2 years!\n\nthe only reason WHY this place got 2 stars is because of the manager (Alberto I think his name was) came over and I showed him my meal, told him of all the issues we had, but what I was most disappointed with is the obvious WAIT time to get the cold food- which was NOT the kitchens fault. \nHe personally promised to go cook my steak himself (he said it just takes 8 minutes!) WOW then Jeff should explain the 45 minutes we waited for our 8 minute steaks. (keep in mind there was only about 4 tables occupied, including ours, in the whole place)\n\nfinally finished our meals and we would've left $1 tip instead of the $5 bill, but that was the smallest bill we had and we had to leave. And this arrogant little dude is going to come over and start making excuses to us? says he was doing all he could to help us? that he didn't know there was a problem? that he had been there 3 months and never had a complaint? (well the manager said he had been there 1 month- I believe the manager) and maybe SO JEFF no one complained- ya know what most PEPLE DONT- they just DON'T come back! after my last visit and review, I was contacted in a very professional way by owner. he handles it exactly as businesses should and I am glad that they take these types of reviews seriously and can actually take note of places to improve upon.\n\nI decided to give them another shot, this time we had a wonderful experience. Our Server, Jacob, was outstanding! never waivered on requests for extra dressing, our glasses did not even get half empty before he politely asked for our glasses to be passed to him (from the inside of table) for a refill.\n\nI tried the garlic and provolone topped sirloin, the garlic was a little over powering for me, raw, and made my mouth burn, easy fix.. I just removed it. There was this nice gravy underneath the steak, which Jacob got us more of since we preferred that to the cheese & garlic topping.\n\nJacob really made this visit pleasant and it was a great experience. We chatted momentarily at the end, I explained I had written a not so pleasant review because of our last server and would be updating the great service & attitude he projected). I had to laugh as he said I was somewhat famous because the review was discussed in a meeting. I am so glad that the company actually made good on their statement that customer service would be addressed and refreshed. Although on last visit there was really only ONE person who really needed a lesson in it. Everyone else was great. This time I was very pleased and will continue to visit this location.\n\nThanks Jacob! and thanks to Jonathon, Alberto and the other staff as well! \nKeep up the great work!", "user_id": "EmpkDgejncKoP9N3HjGptw", "business_id": "BO0zz8gort7o-6KuecIv3Q"}
{"text": "My family of (4) went to Waldhorn for Sunday brunch today.  We had been a couple of times in the past, but not for approximately 5 years.  After our first few bites, we all asked why we waited so long to go back?!?  (I will get back to this later in the review)\n\nThe positives for us:\n~ Great selection of lunch and breakfast foods\n~ The Pretzel Rolls were ridiculously delicious!!  I never tried them before because I had an impression that the roll would be heavy and dense like a typical pretzel and that is not the case at all.  They are fluffy with a nice chewy crust and bits of pretzel salt...add a smear of butter and OMGosh!  For a split-second I was tempted to dump the entire basket into my oversized Coach purse, but thankfully I came to senses quickly!  LOL\n~ The German offerings (Schnitzel, Sauerbraten, Brats, Kielbasa, etc) were all very good.\n~ Fresh Omelet station with a nice selection of toppings\n\nThe service was just ok.  At one point, my son had a dirty plate on the table and he went up to get another plate (including a fresh-made omelet) and the dirty plate was still at the table when he returned.  I'm also on the fence with the desserts.  They weren't consistent.  The Black Forest Cake was excellent, but other items were just ok.  I suspect that they are not fresh made onsite....and some even tasted pre-frozen.\n\nA (major) negative for us was that the fresh carved Roast Beef VERY tough and gristly.  It couldn't be cut with the standard flatware knife.  We had to ask for \"sharp\" knives.  Considering that this was \"the\" big ticket food item (and the one item that I was looking forward to the most), I was really disappointed in the quality of the meat.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn't mention that the price for (4) with gratuity was $111.00.  I was surprised to see that the prices for (4) not-so-great mass-produced coffees and (2) very small servings of juice was $20.00!   I have no problem spending $100+ for a meal that I really loved, but I didn't feel that way with this meal.  I liked it just fine, but it wasn't outstanding by any means.  As I signed my name to the check and tried to reconcile the price vs. value, I then realized why we hadn't been there in 5 years. Up until this week, I had not been a huge fan of LongHorn and this rating is based solely on this one visit. \n\nYou're probably wondering why I continued to go back if I'm not a fan?!?  Great question!  Well...my husband absolutely loves it so I try my best to do the good wifey thing and indulge him every now and again.  :-)   \n\nThis one time, I am actually glad that he didn't give into my protest and he convinced me to go. Our meal was (surprisingly) outstanding!! Not that I ever thought that the food was \"bad\", but it was just \"meh\" for me (and I hate to pay for \"meh\"!).  However, this meal was anything, but \"meh\". This week we decided to try the \"Porterhouse for 2\" and it knocked my socks off!  It was a great piece of meat, seasoned perfectly, cooked properly (medium rare), and seriously delicious. It came with 2 salads (the reason for only 4 stars for this visit...I will get to that later), 2 sides (we had Asparagus and Broccoli), a bulb of roasted garlic (oh, heck yes!!!) and a small bowl of Sizzling Brown Magic known as \"LongHorn Steak Sauce\". Let me preface this by saying that my husband and I are purists when it comes to steak...we don't over season or typically add any sauces (although we do love a good chimichurri). We like to let the meat speak for itself.  But, SWEET BABY JESUS....their steak sauce was awesome! They prepare it tableside and it's served hot. Let me repeat...ITS SERVED HOT! Who woulda thought?!?  If I wasn't afraid of scorching my tongue, I would have liked the bowl clean...it was THAT good!.  \n\nOne taste of the steak with a slice of garlic and a dab of sauce and the angels began to sing. My husband was so happy (and surprised) to see that I was loving it that he was gitty. He even explained our situation to our server and I could hear him getting choked up (not really, but you get my point) when he uttered the words \"she wants to come back\". (You're welcome, honey!) \n\nSo...if it was so darn good...then why the 4 stars (instead of 5)?  3 words...Warm.Salad.Plates.  Seriously, people...cold foods need to be served on cold plates. Even if the plates aren't completely chilled...for the love of all this is right in the world...don't use warm plates for salad!  The server apologized and said that they were training a new salad person and that she used the wrong plates. I get it, but I wanted to ask why she (the server) didn't notice when she picked them up?  hmmm, oh well...I guess going from the typical \"meh\" to absolute perfection was expecting a lot. It was a blip on the radar compared to the rest of the meal, so I've moved on.\n\nWill I go back...YES, but I will only ever order that same meal again. Hopefully, it will be just a good. Consistency is a difficult ask for even the best restaurants. I will be sure to keep you Yelpers posted!", "user_id": "XeDbXueGKrfMLyIG45QIOg", "business_id": "2_0P2AmSSFtPgddio0MgYA"}
{"text": "Overall, I really like Jason's Deli, despite some negatives.  The main reason I like it is that they offer a slew of natural and even a few organic items.  Other reasons I like it is the salad bar with organic mixed greens and the array of toppings you can choose.  It's also a clean establishment, and the service is very quick.  You also get free soft serve ice cream for dessert if you choose to indulge a little bit.  The salad bar also has complimentary mini muffins which are quite tasty.  \n\nThe main negative is the price.  While the salad bar is fairly priced at about $8, you will have to pay extra if you want proteins such as grilled chicken or chicken salad.  They at least have some hard-boiled eggs included in the bar if you want those for protein, as well as some cheese.So if you want a salad with chicken as well as a drink, you're looking at about $11-12, more than you would pay at Ruby Tuesday's for a similar thing, and in a less enjoyable environment.  Another negative, at least to me, is that this place is overrun by south Charlotte kids who have control over their parents.  We witnessed one child smack her mother and neither parent did anything about it.  That was just one of the seemingly 1000 children running freely throughout the place and screaming.  It seriously felt like Chuck E. Cheese.    Another negative, as someone else mentioned, is that there is probably just too much on the menu.  As such, their is no menu board.  People have to take a menu from the counter and then order which causes confusion.\n\nI probably won't go running back to Jason's Deli based mainly on the price, but if it's dinner time and I do, I will likely get my food to go.  I will say that the employees and management were very nice. You know what Olive Garden is and so do I.  Despite being far from authentic, I typically enjoy their food about once or twice a year.  This time we had a gift card, so that was incentive enough to go.  They currently have a 2 for $25 which is okay, but the portions are a lot smaller than their regular entrees.  Yes, you get unlimited salad and breadsticks, but it's just iceberg salad.  The deal also comes with either a small app or a dessert to share.  It was enough for the price, but they should mention the portions are reduced.  Contrary to LR's review, I have ALWAYS taken leftovers home from OG.  I easily ate the whole entree after eating salad and breadsticks.  Unless they just reduced their portion size since the last time I went, these were definitely skimpy and did not come with that much chicken either.  The smoked chicken was decent.\n\nOur friend got the unlimited soup, salad and breadsticks for dinner (yes they offer it for dinner for $3 more) but our less than friendly waitress snagged 2 of her breadsticks off of the table before she was finished. Why would you snag breadsticks from right in front of someone in the first place, let alone someone who has them as part of their meal. The spicy sausage soup she first ordered was mostly broth.  \n\nAll in all, it's not that good and there are better places you could go and not have to wait 45 minutes for a table.  Try a real, local Italian place, like Libretto's up the road or Portofino's on Park Rd.  Their dishes are made by real Italian people, not dreamed up in a corporate kitchen, and they give you your money's worth.  \n\nDrive 5 minutes to Libretto's for real Italian food or 10 minutes to The Carolina Bistro.", "user_id": "4P1AfdABykulRK6C-ww4sw", "business_id": "_Bz6YWNI5bi0gqQI4GLvqQ"}
{"text": "Love, love, love.  Love.  Waldhorn has been on my list forever and I am so glad that I finally got to try it.  Located in Pineville, my GPS guided me directly to the Waldhorn.  Lots of well-lit parking, my evening was off to a good start.\n\nArriving for an early dinner, there were a few folks already partaking and by the time we were done eating (on a random Thursday before Christmas), the place was packed.\n\nAfter ordering our drinks, our friendly waitress brought a basket of dinner rolls and pretzels rolls.  If I had not given up on dating already, I would do it now if I could spend my life eating the pretzel rolls with butter.  So delicious!\n\nMy order of Schweizer Schnitzel, which is a breaded pork cutlet stuffed with black forest ham and swiss cheese, was amazing.  The breading was light and stayed on the meat.  The pork cutlet could have have been cut with a fork - it was juicy and tender.  The ham and cheese added to it, but did not overwhelm the pork.  Served with sides if veggies (carrots, broccoli, squash and zucchini) and spatzle, if I wouldn't have embarrassed my date, I would  have licked the plate, it was incredible and one of the best meals that I have had in a very long time.  \n\nThe dessert of black forest cake was fine - I have had better, but it was light and done right.  My dining companion had an apple dumpling with ice cream and it looked quite good.  Also, she is vegetarian and was able to eat until she was crippled as well, even though German food is very meat-heavy.  \n\nService was wonderful, pricing wasn't outrageous, parking was perfect - I cannot wait to go back to Waldhorn! I do agree with most of the reviews that OG isn't in my top 10 places that I care to dine.  As this location is directly in front of Carolina Place mall (right next to a Red Lobster), there is ALWAYS a wait at peak times, and on the weekends, fuggedaboudit.  I was making a trip to the mall and thought some salad and bread sticks would properly fuel me for a shopping battle.\n\nI arrived right around 5:30 on a Monday, so there was no wait then, but as I was dining, the place began to fill.  I was promptly greeted by my friendly waiter, who kept the drink refills coming throughout my meal without being asked.  They have a current special with soup or salad, plus a selection of entrees, plus a small dessert, for $12.95, so I got that.  The salad was an OG salad, iceberg with various onions and such thrown in, but I do like their salad dressing and the salad was ice cold, which is how I prefer it.  I got a basket of 5 bread sticks for just me, and it was all I could do to not eat all 5.  They were soft and warm and quite tasty.  I got the bucatini with meat sauce for my entree, and it was fine - as expected.  I knew it wasn't going to be the best Italian(ish) dish I had ever had, but it got the job done.  The dessert was a small cake with a strawberry sauce layered in it it (I can't remember the name) and it was fine as well.  It tasted like something from the prepared food section at HT, and it was a sweet finish to my meal.  \n\nThe waitstaff was friendly and attentive without hovering, the food was fine and as expected.

{"text": "Easy in, easy out. Taco Bell is probably one of the easiest to eat and drive. As long as you dig into the burrito just right, it's not going to spill all over you while you're piloting a two ton missile down the highway at 115 feet per second.\n\nI pulled into this TB at 1AM and wasn't paying a whole lot of attention. There's apparently a script. She said \"Can you confirm your order on the screen\" and I just kept saying \"No, that's my complete order\" because I was busy checking in on Yelp and not paying attention. I'm sure that she was halfway to calling the cops and reporting a DUI as I drove off with my \"fourth meal.\" Best Sunday brunch in Charlotte. Period. I could stop there, but I'll go on.\n\nGreat German beers and German delicacies on the buffet line, including sauerbraten, pork loin cooked with bacon, red cabbage, sauerkraut, you name it. The only thing I didn't see was weiner schnitzel, but maybe they have that on other Sundays? Plus of course, all the usual Sunday breakfast things - an omelette station, scrambled eggs, bacon, grits, etc. And an assortment of dessert items.\n\nGreat service with a smaller-sized dining area that helps keep the meal intimate.\n\nI've not been here for a meal other than brunch, but I will absolutely do so and let you know.\n\nNote: Check their website for the Oktoberfest schedule. The place gets crazy busy and I'm not exaggerating. They have local cops here to direct traffic! Booked on Open Table, right after I got the confirming email I called the restaurant and asked if the kitchen table was available. I happen to enjoy sitting in the kitchen. So I was disappointed that my wife and my daughter weren't fans of the experience. But Buca was awesome - they swapped us right out into another table immediately without a wait. Woot!\n\nWe chose the large tossed salad to start and then three big entrees to share. Yep, that was probably too much food. Huge platter of Eggplant Parmesan. Big tray of cheese manicotti. Ginormous vat of shrimp fettuccine Alfredo. All really delicious, all really big servings. We took a shedload of it home with us.\n\nAs for the desserts, they are ALSO sized to share. The brownie sundae, by itself, is enough for five people. And we also had what we thought was going to be ONE canoli but was actually three of 'em. Oy, my tummy hurts. Popped in for a take out order on a very busy Sunday afternoon. I don't know why the OG gets so busy on family holidays like Mother's Day, but on this one it was packed solid with people waiting outside, inside and in the bar area.\n\nWe were able to place our to go order with the very busy takeout manager. That guy should get five stars. But the rest of the place, not so much. We sat at the bar for 30 minutes waiting to place the order and then waiting for it. Could someone have asked us if we wanted a drink? Maybe offered a glass of water? Nope.\n\nThe food was OG standard but again it was packed perfectly with the salad in an interesting container that kept the lettuce and such fresh with the dressing and croutons separate. They also put a separator to keep the cold stuff from affecting the hot stuff.\n\nTwo stars because the place was less than tidy and the bar staff didn't seem interested in customers. Otherwise, it would have been pretty good.", "user_id": "VhI6xyylcAxi0wOy2HOX3w", "business_id": "vtJAnB4gBgTJKv3mOnOF_w"}
{"text": "Great little spot for wings in the south side of town. A lot of to go orders ~ the place is nice - bus station like booths and a TV to watch while you munch on their delicious wings. Haven't tried the pizza yet ...  The wings are good and reasonably priced. Lots of fl\u00e0vors to choose from. Excellent food affordable price ... Salad bar is stocked and sandwiches are always overflowing with whatever meat selection you order. My favorite is the beef stew soup. So good on a cold January night ! Has just enough spice to add a pleasant kick to the meaty beefy soup base. The meal was Filet, with asparagus and salad though right now I am not eating oil of any kind so the salad was not an option - I opted for the grilled shrimp instead ... Steak was delicious - the asparagus was cooked to death and worn out and the grilled shrimp was good though the manager wanted no part of offering any consideration of discount for the salad I didn't order ... \nLong story short - go to Outback Steakhouse right around the corner and get treated remarkable and get food you want with no hassles mate ! \nWon't make this mistake again - too many choices in Charlotte to have to dicker over $6.00 !  Outback would not only have accommodated my request but would have checked to make sure I was happy ... \nLonghorn was NOT crowded - hum. ... Probably why ... Carlos the manager is cheap and not customer friendly ! So after 2 years we finally came back for a second try. I ordered coffee, pecan salad and the ribeye. My hubby ordered coffee, Cobb salad and filet.  The coffee was sent back as it was old and tasted like it was made two days before. The pecan salad was good - however it was drowning in dressing so much that it was hard to eat. The ribeye was good. No complaints. \nThe hubs filet was too raw so we sent it back for a 2nd go at an attempt to heat to a true med well.  His salad had no issues so all in all it was what we expected. \nOur expectations were not too high and the restaurant delivered just that. A sub par service with eatable yet not great food. \nFor a chain restaurant advertising as a Steak house you would think it would be better.  It's not. Middle of the road at best. Way over priced for what we ended up with. Everything pasta ! BuonAppetito ! So our first impression was we would be here awhile since parking was full. Surprisingly enough we were seated in less than 10 minutes. Our server was prompt and informative and our first course arrived on our table less than 8 minutes from the time we ordered it! \nThe salad had only one complaint and it seems to be a consistent issue with this restaurant - one that really doesn't make sense to me - olives ! There are two olives in the large bowl of salad ... If you want more than two olives, you have to ask for them - which is strange since their very name boasts of them ! Have found this to be the case each to time I've eaten here. \nSpaghetti & meat sauce was my meal and it\n was yummy.  Hubs had seafood Alfredo . He said he wouldn't recommend it again but it was just okay. \n\nTiramsu was delicious and the coffee was fresh and piping hot !\nNo complaints other than the olive shortage ...", "user_id": "ybG5P8QlP5rA58yd7NRqDg", "business_id": "lX3XYcMWoRlHjrmkoGNefQ"}
{"text": "This morning we decided to get up and head out for brunch, and what's better than a brunch buffet on a nice Easter Sunday?\n\nOf course, living in Charlotte, that could be a problem.  It's a well-known fact that there are only two brunch buffet resaturants in Charlotte.  One of them can be found at Ballantyne, but it's rather expensive.  Luckily, we have the Waldhorn to come to the rescue (there are a few other restaurants in Charlotte that step up for Easter, but why reward them?).\n\nThe only problem is that the Waldhorn was packed.  As early as Wednesday, there were no reservations left.  So we showed up at about 11:30 and took our chances.  The day was nice, so we thought we might sit outside.  No such luck.  The wait was as long as 40 minutes.  Luckily, there were seats at the bar.  With zero wait.  Sweet!  We took them up on the offer and had a great time.\n\nIf you go for dinner, be warned that their service can really stink. Even if they are half-full, the service is bad. Glasses can remain half-full as well. Mostly it seems to depend on who else is there - for instance if a large party is ahead of you in line. The best bet is either to sit at the bar or to go for brunch, in which case you're all good. Though it is a chain, this is one of those places that you just have to visit to appreciate.  It's not your typical chain in that every visit is unique.  The food is served 'family style', so when you see 'small' and 'large', make sure you note that the small serves 2 and the large serves 4.  Also note that those are probably conservative estimates.\n\nThe food is excelltent, and the only downside is that the service varies with your server.  Sometimes it is good, sometimes it is bad.  Generally they are friendly but that doesn't always mean that they are good at their job. It's been more than three years since my original review of Buca, so I figured it's time to write again.\n\nThough we still like Buca, and the experience is one that you should really check out if you haven't already, I'm not sure that I'd suggest you do so as heartily as I did before.\n\nFor starters, the plates of food seem to have found their way to Dr. Evil's shrinking ray.  It's not uncommon these days for portions to shrink, but for whatever reason - perhaps because Buca already had large prices to begin with - the difference just seems to be much more pronounced.  We still love the shtick, but it's a bit harder to swallow is all.\n\nWhen it comes to value, it's not there as much as it used to be.  The flavors haven't changed, and they seem to have put a lot of money into a fancy new menu to get you to buy into their plan, rather than the relatively simple menu that they used to have.  The servers even seem to be working on the hard-sell now, rather than the simple family style that used to work so well.  It just isn't the same. Blech.  I think I must have been at a different buffet than these other reviewers, because this was horrible.  When we walked in, it was like we were in the South Pacific.  Seriously.  The thermostat must have been set at 90.  A nice change from the 40 degree weather outside, but after about three minutes, it was the worst.  Maybe that's for atmosphere, but it was not enjoyable.\n\nTo make the experience even less appetizing, the place is cramped and the staff does not help at all in this regard - they are constantly in the middle of the aisles, writing tickets and getting drinks in the middle of the walking areas and the like.  Again, they could be going for atmosphere, and having the staff constantly around is nice, but with overbearing heat and little room to move it's not good.  It's bad.  Really bad.  If you don't like personal space, you're good.  Really good even.  Otherwise, it stinks.  Literally.  I've been to restaurants in big cities, where rent is outrageous, that have more room to move than this.  In Pineville, there ought to be all sorts of elbow room (Schoolhouse Rock anyone?).\n\nYes, there is a sushi bar where a guy makes it in front of you.  Let me first tell you that I'm not really a sushi guy.  I like California rolls and those little rice cakes with shrimp on them, and a few other things, but none of the more exotic stuff.  But this was nasty.  He would take a big fried thing and plop it down on a plate and squirt some heavy mayo-like sauce all over it.\n\nThat's not too bad, right?  Well, once the rolls were gone, he'd do it again - without cleaning the plate.  That's right, there was a buildup of this mayo on the platter.  Several varieties, all right there under the lights.  It was pretty sickening.  Like a sushi hog pond.\n\nOn the regular buffet, it wasn't too bad, but it wasn't that good either.  If you want a Southern food buffet (meat, rolls, corn), it's okay.  But the Chinese food was just average.  Add that to the place, the staff, the price - go elsewhere.  China King and Dragon House aren't far away, and Tin Tin is just up the street (though I'm not a huge fan of Tin Tin either).  You'll have a much nicer experience.", "user_id": "-_1ctLaz3jhPYc12hKXsEQ", "business_id": "2_0P2AmSSFtPgddio0MgYA"}

The section  that we are in contains  several screaming children, wonderful... Our  waitress  is Eva. She brought  our drinks right away and our orders are in, hopefully  the food will be good.\n\nWell the coconut shrimp were kind of bland and the sauce that accompanied them really didn't liven them up. The fish and chips was tasty. The cod was light & fluffy & cooked to perfection and definitely hit the spot. The French fries were decent as well. iHop is one of our favorite restaurants for late night suppers. We prefer not to go when the rest of the area eats. Our experiences there have been mixed. Servers that I can recommend are Spring & Tiffany who will go the extra distance to make sure you have plenty to drink & refresh your hot maple syrup.\n\nUnfortunately we have also had servers who think that making you wait 1/2 hour or more for your check is the way to win a big tip. In that instance the server never returned & we had the meal comped by the manager who told us that she had gone across the street for baby formula. As we were leaving she was pulling up. Another server told me that the reason we had to wait so long to leave was because she had to go to the bathroom. On one of our most recent visits our server told us that the reason that our food was cold, that we got no drink refills, that he couldn't give us our check in a timely manner was because he was \" running around like a chicken with his head cut off.\"\n\nMy wife had ordered cheese soup & a sandwich when we had the chicken as a waiter. The soup came out cold & it resembled snot. The manager took it off our bill.\n\nOn our last visit the manager served us herself & it was a great meal with excellent service. I like iHop because its cheap & you get decent sized portions. I love the all you can eat pancakes even though I can never eat more than a single plate. \n\nIf you're worried about shenanigans dining there late at night don't worry. Pineville stations an officer there from 12am - 5am. My wife and I had great service from Spring when we ate here a few nights ago. We always ask for either her or Tiffany. Unfortunately the steak tips and eggs that I ordered for dinner were foul. The steak was either overcooked or it was bordering on raw. Thank Gods for the fluffy buttermilk pancakes & hot maple syrup. Without them I'd have gone hungry that night.\n\nYou might wonder why we continue to eat there given the plethora or marginal experiences, well it is very cheap & its closer to the house than driving down to Carrowinds to go to Cracker Barrel. We went to iHOP this evening. Spring was out so we got served by Bob the manager. We both had sweet tea and ham & egg melts with fries. Everything was good. Bob is a good waitress. He was prompt with our drink refills. We were greeted by Tracy the manager who decided to serve us along with our faithful waitress Sky. We sat in our usual booth & had a couple sweet teas. My wife had wings and a salad. I had a burger without the bacon interwoven into it. Overall it was a good meal with a lot of iHop gossip being passed along.", "user_id": "q200TCFOheJfS_MvvwMfJw", "business_id": "BO0zz8gort7o-6KuecIv3Q"}
{"text": "Legends...interesting name. With a name like Legends, one would assume sports bar, but not so much. And I very much liked it that way! Let's roll into a pro/con list...\n\nPros:\n-Great, friendly service. Morgan was my server and she was super fantastic. Quick, efficient, sweet. She offered up helpful suggestions and even let me try a sample of the soup of the day before I placed my order.\n-Homemade focaccia: Mmmm rosemary! Tasty and free slivers of love to go with your meal. \n-Portions: Mammoth. From the bowls of soup to the pastas to the pies...sharing is caring.\n-Spinach ravioli: My main dish of choice. Flavorful spinach and cheese pillows of pasta cooked al dente and smothered with tomato basil sauce with a touch of cream. Damn good pasta, my friends.\n\nCons:\n-Menu items price out a few dollars higher than similar Italian joints. But, the value is here, though, because of the increased portions. \n-Restaurant set up/ambiance: Is a bit odd. It's kinda like a diner...with bare tables...and carpet...and a few random pictures on the wall. \n-No booze, beer or wine. It is BYO, but I didn't see the corkage fees listed on their menu.\n\nOverall, a solid place for homecooked Italian eats. I would sprint back to Legends just for that ravioli! Mangia! I like Jason's Deli. They have pretty chipper employees, a clean establishment, a nice array of soups, sandwiches and salads and free ice cream and muffins. Really, what's not to like? \n\nI try to eat healthy-ish 80-90% of the time, so I was perusing the menu looking for a tasty wrap or sandwich. The Ranchero wrap stood out in all its spicy glory: Organic wheat wrap with natural, grilled chicken breast, cheddar, jalape\u00f1os, pico de gallo, Southwest spices, ranch dressing. Served with organic blue corn tortilla chips and salsa for $6.99. \n\nWas this wrap tasty? Yes. Should I have, perhaps, asked for the ranch on the side? Yes...because thanks to Jason's very well put together website and easily accessible nutrition information, this wrap bombed me with 680 calories, 28 grams of fat and more than 2,000 grams of sodium. Damn Gina. \n\nNow, I'm not blaming this establishment for serving highly caloric items...it happens. I like Jason's. I just have to be a bit more careful of what I order! So...it's been at least two years since I've been to McNinch and I still remember the experience like it was yesterday. And I have to agree with Bill on this one, it's pretty amazing.\n\nHubs and I decided to try this illustrious resto for Valentine's Day in 2008, we went through the whole reservation process, custom menu, custom wine pairings - the whole shebang. We actually followed all their directions to a t and arrive early, enjoyed some champagne while taking a tour of the sweet little home/restaurant on Church St. And then the incredible began...\n\nWe were blown away (for the entire 3+ hours) by the spectacular pairings of food and wine, accompanied by fantastic service. I know we saved our menu for quite some time, but I'm not sure where it ran off to. Every single course was creatively prepared and tons of local ingredients were immersed into the dishes. Our server was also extremely knowledgable in each wine, explaining its heritage and vineyard to us. \n\nSince we choose the wine pairing option, we quite literally had a different (and interesting) glass of wine with every of the seven courses. Good thing we lived in the Fourth Ward at that time. Hey-oo!\n\nMcNinch House is such a special place to experience an amazing meal. It's pricey and well worth every penny: I'm still talking about my meal 2.5 years later. We probably spent about $400 all in, including the wine pairings for each of us, seven courses and tip. An expensive meal for sure, but it's wonderful for a anniversary or milestone celebration.", "user_id": "lpZtfD-vCqUER1yGKEvUPw", "business_id": "q_BKmbdlYfQJroJVHfYMUQ"}
{"text": "I zoom. I zoom, I walk fast, I multitask - every movement I make is planned for efficiency. Therefore, Jason's Deli is my lunch spot of choice and here is why. I can just walk up to the salad bar kiosk, touch the screen a few times, slide my card and walk two steps to where a smiling person hands me my plate and cup. Quick. I have waited in line maybe one time even when the sandwich line is out the door. \nJason's salad bar is the best I have found. The ingredients are always fresh and the selection is good. Yes I am a fan of Jason's in Pineville. I am a fan of Jason's and a definite regular. I love, love the salad bar. My only complaint - please don't put ice in the salad bar ingredients. I know you want to keep it fresh but sorting out the cauliflower from the ice is a pain and I ultimately end up with a pool of water in my bowl. The Pineville store is MY Jason's. Service is always great. Several employees greeted me when I came in and they were busy too. I always feel welcome. I do love the instant salad bar line where you can jump the big line and order a salad (plus soup and proteins) on a card-only kiosk. I NEVER wait which is one of the reasons I go to Jason's. The other main reason I go to Jason's is the salad bar. It's always fresh and has some nice extras. The only negatives are that frequently the lettuce is wetter than I like and they put ice down in some of the vegetables which ends up in my salad. Also I miss the cauliflower!\nMinor details. They do a good job at Jason's Pineville. Not all chain locations are created equal but Olive Garden seems to do a good job maintaining consistency. With that said, MY Olive Garden is located in Pineville at Carolina Place Mall. I go there for lunch and typically sit at the bar. I can always just sit right down and not have to wait in line. \n\nThe food is always good. I love the soup and salad combination - it's perfect for lunch. But the BEST PART OF SITTING AT THE BAR IS BEING SERVED BY VILDEN. Vilden is, without fail, friendly and attentive. Sometimes when I am deciding on where to have lunch, I go because of Vilden. I know she will make me feel welcome and appreciated. Service always great when I sit at the bar for lunch. I'm in a rut but always order the soup and salad combination. It's perfect actually and very consistent up until my last visit. This time the pasta e fagole was way too thick - it had crossed from soup to stew-land which was not what I came for. I hope it was just a brief short coming and not a change of recipe.\n\nAnother problem this visit is that Olive Garden has decided putting tablets in everyone's face is a really great idea. They were placed up and down the bar with bright animated images. Can we not just sit and have some peace and a little chat with the bartender or another diner? I also wonder if the cameras on the tablets are operational. It just seems intrusive. Long time Charlotte establishment McNinch House is a dining experience, not just a restaurant. Located in a beautiful Fourth Ward Victorian house, you are dining in an elegant setting. Make sure that you really like the person you're with because an evening at McNinch House is an investment in time. Enjoy yourself - do not feel rushed - pace your beverages - dinner will definitely take a while.\n\nMy dining partner and I chose the four course dinner. There are options that offer additional courses as well as wine parings if you wish. Wine is also available by the glass, bottle and as flights. \n\nWe chose crab cakes as our first course. When the plates were served, I thought I was seeing two small biscuits on the plate (yes, the lighting is somewhat dim.) The crab cakes were beautiful and wonderful. The two crab cakes were predominantly chunks of crab with very little seasoning, dusted with a soft flour and very lightly browned. They were served with a lightly dressed slaw and the combination was right on. Perfect. \n\nBeing in a crab state of mind, we chose she crab soup for our second course. The creme fraiche made in house really added to the flavor of this dish. The small addition of sherry was just right.\n\nMy companion and I parted company with the entree. She had the rack of lamb and I chose the duck breast. The rack of lamb was cooked to perfection, nicely displayed and exactly what she expected. My duck breast was also perfectly cooked. It was served with a cherry reduction and sweet potato hash. \n\nFor dessert, we chose their evening's cheesecake. Thinking I would receive the normal size portion, I thought I would be wasting much of my dessert. When the plates arrived, I was very pleased to see a beautiful, small portion. The flavor was wonderful. I ate the whole thing! It was just right.\n\nWith one exception, the food was five stars. Unfortunately I detected a slight burned flavor in the cherry reduction. It was about 30 seconds too cooked. But that was not enough to ruin the whole food experience.\n\nMy greater concern involved service. McNinch House is a first class restaurant. I didn't feel like the service was first class for these reasons: we arrived about 10 minutes before our reservation time. The door was locked and after a while we were met at the door by one of the servers. We felt awkward when he said for us to wait and look around if we wished. I would have preferred him to take my coat then and offer to take a drink order. The waiting was not a problem, the awkwardness was. Secondly, the servers did not stick with the tried and true rules of which side to serve and from which side to remove plates. In several instances the servers crossed in front of us to remove something from the table in spite of the fact there was plenty of room behind both of us. Lastly, I don't mind an automatic gratuity and I don't object to a 20% gratuity since I normally tip that amount anyway. What I do object to is tipping on the taxed amount. This means I am tipping on more than 20% and I don't think that is right at all.\n\nI hope to someday return to McNinch House. I do recommend this restaurant with some reservation (but not the food - it was wonderful.)", "user_id": "6f9xCzChuA5eBoxoR6EmAQ", "business_id": "_Bz6YWNI5bi0gqQI4GLvqQ"}
{"text": "I try to eat healthy on most days, but sometimes you just want to be bad and scarf down a couple chili dogs. This is the place to go to fulfill that urge. \n\nGreen's is a Charlotte institution. An old school lunch counter that also offers burgers, sandwiches, crinkle fries, onion rings, etc... but the dog is the way to go here. Unless you are my pal Eddie, who swears by the livermush sandwich here.\n\nIt's nothing fancy. Just a lunch spot where you can get a hot dog done right. I suggest getting it slathered in Green's homemade chili.\n\nThere is a parking lot next to the building. It is a pay lot. I recommend parking on the street and feeding the meter instead.\n\nI guess my only real complaint about Green's is that it's not open on Sundays, unless the Panthers are at home. Time to update ye old Green's Lunch review.\n\nI've been coming here for almost 11 years. My seven year old fake nephew loves this place. He's a real kid, we're just not actually related. This is what happens when you're my age and all your friends have kids. You become Aunt Nikki. And I love every minute about it.\n\nThere's nothing fancy here. It's not the best food on the planet. It's an old-school, Charlotte institutions serving up burgers, dogs and fries since 1926. Order at the counter then walk over to pay at the register. There are booths and stools with a lunch counter. Ketchup, Texas Pete, and napkins are on all the tables.\n\nYou can't beat the prices. Three adults and a child we spent $29 on lunch today. The kid had a hot dog and fries, the adults had three grilled cheeses, three chili dogs, a cheeseburger and chili cheese fries. Yes, we're those people. Add on a couple drinks and that's quite a meal for less than 30 bucks.\n\nThey do breakfast here. There's a Green's lunch cart over at the Wells Fargo Plaza. They also offer catering. \n\nThings to know:\n1) They have the good ice\n2) Free WiFi\n3) Skip the parking lots around it. Look for street parking at the meters on Poplar. Download the Parkmobile app and it's as easy as scanning the meter to pay.\n4) Romare Bearden is right across the street. Go for a walk in the park afterwards or let the kids play. We usually take the seven year old over before or after lunch to play catch or kickball. \n5) Closed on Sundays unless the Panthers are playing at home\n6) They're open for Knights home games until 7pm Need a good, unique date spot? Here's the place. Great little hidden gem in uptown's historic 4th Ward neighborhood.\n\nFood: First things first... whatever meal you get make sure to get a cup or bowl of the spicy crab soup. Money. Not so hungry or just want a snack? The fried pickles are spot on. The London Broil is just fantastic. The marinade they use on it is super delicious. Dinner version comes sliced up in entree form... lunch as a sandwich. You get a side item with both.\n\nBar: They have a good selection of local beers. If the restaurant is busy and you can't get a table... sit here. The service is always top notch.\n\nParking: there is a lot less than a block from the restaurant between Graham and Pine. There seems to be a lot of confusion surrounding parking here. I think a lot of it is because the signs are kind of confusing. You can park there for two hours without a parking permit. Bonus: had too much to drink and need to take a cab? The A Mike's staff will you show you where you can park your car overnight.\n\nI love to bring out of town guests here. Such a charming place in a great neighborhood. Warm, welcoming, homey atmosphere.", "user_id": "W6LTsXcY1R76M9EdeN0G6A", "business_id": "LT0AgHTpDifuHSXgyLmJwg"}
{"text": "Amazing and authentic German food! We just got back from a trip to Germany (Nuremberg and Munich) and the food took me right back to our trip. \n\nWe have been here numerous times for food and beer. They have an excellent selection of Belgium beers....some of these I actually drank in Germany.\n\nCame here for lunch today with my husband. We both ordered the bratwurst sandwich. It was a bratwurst split in half, covered with craut, and on a soft pretzel bun. So many flavors and soooooo good! Definitely recommend it! \n\nOverall, excellent spot with great authentic beer and food. \n\nPS- A few month ago when we went here, we ended up chatting with our server for a long time. She was from Germany and was extremely knowlegable about German food and culture. It was so interesting talking with someone who just recently moved to the US from Germany. Went here on Sunday. We don't usually go to chain restaurants, simply because there are so many delicious locally owned restaurants in the area. However, we had a gift card and decided to go have dinner. \n\nWe got there around 6 and had no wait for a table. However, when we left, there was alot of people in the lobby waiting for a seat.\n\nWe both ordered a glass of the house red. Well priced and very good for a house wine.\n\nI ordered the soup and salad with the pasta fagoli soup. My husband ordered the lasagna primavera from the lighter side part of the menu (it had spinach and veggies in it).\n\nBreadsticks and salad came out like expected. The breadsticks are alway delish and hard to turn away eating more. The soup was very good and my husbands lasagna was even better. However, we were joking that there is no wonder that the lasagna was on the lighter side. It was so small!! I guess we should have expected that, given that making lasagna \"light\" isn't an easy task. I can't even begin to explain to you how small it was......AND normally we normally split meals at restaurants, so we are typically used to smaller portions to begin with! Probably the size of half a deck of cards (width, length, and height) with like 3 small pieces of grilled chicken on it. He ate it and didn't complain....it was tasty, though!\n\nNormally we skip dessert but when the waitress came by, my husband ordered the pumpkin cheesecake (not sure if it was because he was still hungry or just craving something sweet!). This was SO good. HUGE slice of cheesecake. Very tasty and that slice was gone in like 5 minutes haha. \n\nOverall, ok experience, just wouldnt go back unless we had another gift card. My parents were in town this weekend and we decided to take them to Alexander Michael's, simply because I have always felt that this place is exactly what represents Charlotte!\n\nParking in 4th Ward isnt the easiest. However, we were able to find a spot on the street relatively close. Alexander Michael's is an adorable house in 4th Ward. Please make sure to read the back of the menu for the story about this place! \n\nThe wait was about 45 minutes and the place was standing room only at the time. However, we were able to grab some drinks at the bar. They had Triple C Baby Maker on tap, so I was a happy girl! Lots of local brews!\n\nWe started with the fried pickles as we looked over the menu. Delicious ranch. For our meals, I convinced my Dad to order the What Is It, because I have had it before and loved it! I knew it would be right up his alley. He finished the whole thing and really enjoyed his meal. I had a bite and it was just as good as I remembered. I ordered the black bean burger with a cup of crap soup. The soup is absolutely amazing!!! Chunks of crab. This is a must order item every time. The black bean patty was nicely done and i liked that it was served on a pita, instead of a bun. Both my husband and mom ordered the chicken sandwich and enjoyed their meals. \n\nService at the table was just ok. To be quite honest, it felt fairly rushed, which is a bit annoying when you wait 45 minutes. However, the guy taking names down for the wait was fantastic. He was really on it! Actually, he seemed like a jack of all trades cause I saw him cleaning a table and bringing drinks out also! He was just so fun to interact with.\n\nThis is a great casual spot for a date or just a night out with some friends!", "user_id": "Hg4GF6sHT_9tuHIvrfpkpw", "business_id": "2_0P2AmSSFtPgddio0MgYA"}
{"text": "Visited the Waldhorn last Friday evening in attempt to fit in the last weekend of their Oktoberfest Celebration.\n\nWhen I think of where I want to eat, German food doesn't exactly jump to the front of the line... but after going to the Waldhorn - I'm definitely a fan and to have a german restaurant in Charlotte/Pineville is a real treat.\n\nThe parking situation was a bit crazy since I guess it was the last weekend for Oktoberfest so everyone was trying to get their Waldhorn on that night (and I'm sure the night after that).  I ended up parking at the James K. Polk memorial center and walking up to the restaurant.  \n\nI had a large group of people with me from the office so getting a table took a little bit of time.  We had someone go early and put in our names for a group of 10.\n\nWhen we finally got seated, our waitress was very nice and understanding since it is sometimes hard to order with the traditional German vernacular - Lots of pointing and the waitress finishing our sentences were involved.  \n\nI had the Bratwurst Platte and enjoyed every bit of it.  There were 3 types of bratwurst on the plate along with a healthy portion of sauerkraut.  I cleaned my plate along with a LITER of Spaten Oktoberfest (amber ale) that was heaven.  The waitress kept a basket of bread/pretzel bread full and they were nice a hot out of the oven.\n\nAfter diner, we proceeded to go into the tent behind the restaurant to enjoy the German band, dancing, festivities, and more beer.  Definitely a great way to celebrate Oktoberfest! IHOP is IHOP... it's great for it's consistency wherever you go.  Usually when I hit up IHOP it's on the weekends and you end up fighting the crowds, but if you time it just right... your IHOP experience can be a good one.\n\nThis experience recently on a Saturday happened to be after a 4 mile run so we were super super hungry.  I was pleasantly surprised since they offer some new healthy options.  I had the wheat french toast combo with turkey bacon and scrambled egg beater eggs.  Not too bad for 490 calories.  Good way to start the day. Can't believe I haven't reviewed AM yet!!  Thought I had a long long time ago.  Great great spot in the 4th ward.  I wish I had more excuses to go meet people here and drink and eat.\n\nWhen I used to work downtown I hiked over here (way away from everything downtown) but it is worth it!  If you only have 1hr for lunch... maybe not if you are rushing, but definitely come for dinner or drinks after work.  \n\nThere's a really cool \"neighborhood\" feel to this place and everyone is in close quarters, but that's part of the charm of this place.  It's pretty dark and dim at night but it sets a cool mood for hanging out, watching a sports game, or catching up with people over some spirits. Might not be the easiest location to visit or see, but it's a good option because of the people that work here.  Tucked away across a parking lot and underneath an overhand is this Showmars location, but there are a lot of regulars that frequent this place.  The servers and folks running the register are super nice and they recognize you, call you by name, and ask how your work day is going.\n\nI take my lunch around 1pm so WAY after the lunch rush, but I can imagine this place being super busy.  There are a lot of tables and booths to sit at and the food comes out fast - with daily specials.\n\nSuper affordable and predictable, you can have you food in front of you pretty quickly - especially if you are trying to do a quick lunch.\n\nNow, this place is pretty practical if you work Uptown and can walk here for lunch.  Probably not a place to drive to since you would have to pay for parking somewhere... even if you park on the street at a metered spot.", "user_id": "4G68oLRY3aHE5XUt_MUUcA", "business_id": "2_0P2AmSSFtPgddio0MgYA"}
{"text": "I too don't understand the low ratings for this place. As others have said you've got to keep your expectations in perspective when visiting a mall food court. For a quick and tasty fast food experience I really love Sarku Japan. They do cook the food fresh to order and I usually order their Teriyaki chicken special. Their teriyaki isn't too sweet which I like and it carmelizes on the chicken for a really great flavor. Because I'm a big guy who likes to eat I get the double meat, spring roll and drink combo. All this for just over $10. In my book and palate I think this is a pretty good deal. This is a review of the Hot Dog CART, not the restaurant.....However, I am rating their food (Chili Dogs), so here goes...\n\nMet by Kim the Cart lady, and she was super friendly and explained all about Green's, how long they've been in business, etc. She also told me it was her birthday today, so Happy Birthday Kim! Told her that this big boy was a hungry, so she fixed me up with 2 loaded chili dogs, done \"Green's Way\" (minus the slaw - I still haven't learned how to love that). Got my Cheerwine and chips and headed back to the office to enjoy my lunch.\n\nHummmm, when I started eating the dogs, the FIRST thing that came to my mind was that 1980's Wendy's commercial with Clara Peller.....\"WHERE'S THE BEEF?\" Or in this case, WHERE's the DOG? Man it was tiny. The next thing I noticed was that the chili wasn't super flavorful either. In fact, it reminded me very much like \"the other chili guy\" down the street (he who's name cannot be mentioned). BLAND. I guess my version of chili and theirs is totally different! Go to the Charlotte Chili festival in Plaza Midwood and tell me how these 2 compare to that chili! No comparison!\n\nLook, the dogs weren't bad at all. Relatively tasty, and the combo was less than $8. Not bad....\n\nHOWEVER, let me tell you something Uptown workers of Charlotte.....there are 2 OTHER Street Vendors who sell hot dogs, both sporting the Sabrett Logo. They give you JUMBO dogs and FLAVORFUL chili that blows away either Green's or \"the other chili guy who cannot be mentioned.\" I would LOVE to do a BLIND taste comparison to see if my taste buds are on. And they are cheaper than Greens or the other guy.\n\nSo I'll give Ms Kim 5 STARS for being a Sweetheart, but the food can only be rated as average. Was taking the famous Fourth Ward Secret Gardens Tour on this beautiful Sunday....which was awesone by the way. Saw that Alexander Michaels was open for this event. Was immediately greeted by Cooper, the host and owner's son. And yes ladies he is a \"hunk.\" And a hell of a nice guy too! I shared some of the other female Yelp reviews with him and he laughed.\n\nDue to the other Yelp reviews I started with the fried pickles. Theirs were very lightly battered so you can actually TASTE the pickles! I thought that was great, along with the standard Ranch dipping sauce.\n\nCooper recommended the Penne Athena which was a nice, light chicken dish with black olives, red peppers and a light mushroom cream sauce. Very tasty and indeed not too heavy following my walkibg tour. \n\nOverall very good! Cooper, Milt at the bar were super gracious and friendly hosts! Can't wait to come back to try their 4th Ward Stroganoff. The reason I like Showmars is that you pretty much always know what you're going to get...and that is good home cooked food, and quickly. No different here at this location. I've read some recently negative reviews for this location....but I had a really good experience.\n\nFirst off, this place gets VERY busy before most businesses starting work time....lots of banking folks sitting around me. I grabbed a seat at the counter to watch the chaos in the Kitchen, and to watch the ONE waitress bust her tail in order to make her customers happy. I also find it amazing how very hard Latino cooks work back in the kitchen, and how quickly they can switch from getting their orders in English yet speak Spanish back there among each other. Their head cook was about as hard working an Expeditor as I've seen, repeating every order and making sure his line cooks get it done right.\n\nMy little blonde waitress was filling in for someone who apparently called in sick, and she was uber busy yet kept me happy with coffee and getting my order in and to me very quickly (like 5 minutes). \n\nSo I'd say the STAFF here easily gets 5 STARS. Very hard working and efficient.\n\nNow that I've painted the picture on how this place operates, let me tell you about my Greek Omelet. I got it with Gyro meat and grilled onions, and it was very good! Hash browns and English Muffin were acceptable and average. But the Greek Omelet was filled with tomatoes, feta cheese, gyro meat, grilled onions and some Greek spices. Not overcooked and quite tasty overall. Good size too.\n\nI got about the most expensive thing on the menu and had a coffee and it came out to just over $10. They have MANY breakfast items that hover around $5 if you didn't want to get one of their \"signature\" dishes.\n\nSo if you're Uptown and want a good, home cooked meal, come to Showmars....just don't expect Dean and Deluca quality (nor their prices).", "user_id": "X36p3mD4oqBE53sASc_Ykw", "business_id": "ji0VxQpFQvzzYMy9fY5fvw"}
{"text": "Overall a pretty relaxed atmosphere for drinking and/or eating. Mostly an older crowd (+35), but the occasional table of college kids hanging out during the late hours. \n\nDecent selection of beer on tap, & wide selection of bottled beer, wine, & liquor. The alcohol specials aren't anything too special & really doesn't provide a reason to visit if solely looking for specials. Plus, they've recently raised their prices & now have about the same prices as Sammy's, which I don't think bodes well for business. Also, Bentley's & Sammy's actually have daily specials that give people a reason to go there & drink.\n\nThe menu could use an upgrade, but if looking for some average bar food then this should fit your needs. From pizza, to sandwiches, to fried foods, it has all the typical bar specialties, but def could use some spicing up to draw more of a dinner crowd.\n\nOverall, the wait staff makes you feel at home & it is a good place to relax and have a few drinks with friends. If you're looking to grab some good Italian food for dinner, then this place is great. Whether you're going with your family or on a date, it doesn't matter because the atmosphere of this place is unlike any other place you'll go.\n\nWalking in, heck, even the outside of the place, you'll be amazed at the tackiness. Being half Italian, this place brings back a lot of memories of my grandmother's place. It's just so amazingly tacky, from the different types of rooms you can eat in, to the stuff on the walls & ceilings. \n\nBuca is unique because of how they separate the seating. There are different types of themes for each room & each is very unique. I've sat in the Wine Room twice & filled wine racks cover the entire ceiling. There's also a pope room, with a spinning pope head in the middle of the table...yes...very weird. Also, I believe you have to reserve the booth located in the kitchen, but this is where you can watch the workings of the kitchen from inside of it.\n\nThe food here is great as well, with your normal favorites with some other odd creations. They have giant meatballs which are great for more than one person. You can order individual portions, but they're specialty is family style dining. So bring some people with you that have hearty appetites because you get a lot of food here.\n\nThis place may be a chain, but it's definitely a must visit if you're an Italian food fan...which I have no idea who isn't. From the uniqueness & tackiness of the place, to the great food you'll get to feed your whole party, you'll enjoy yourself & look forward to coming back soon. While this place has a good # of tvs, for some reason I just don't enjoy watching games here. The view is decent from almost anywhere in the bar, but I think the lack of a loud fan base really takes away from the atmosphere. No one seems too thrilled that the games are on & not much cheering seems to be done. They also have a large projection screen showing the main game so if you can get a seat in front of this it's pretty good viewing. And flat screens are located throughout showing other games throughout the day.\n\nI've never had the food here, I've only been for the nightlife/game watching, so I can't comment on the menu or the food taste. There's a good selection of beer both on tap & in bottles. The prices are pretty on par with any bar/restaurant located on Tryon in Charlotte, so I can't really complain here. They also have a couple pool tables, and a lounge upstairs if you want to get out of the main bar scene.\n\nFox & Hound won't blow you away with anything, especially if you're there to watch a game. It always seems to be packed so there must be something that keeps bringing people back again & again. Check it out & you may actually like it better than me if you don't like the loud sports crowd but still want to watch the game.", "user_id": "Zwsq31eNUo2HpdkV2h9aig", "business_id": "OkV0BMQxRRYJ5t5sbeU93A"}
{"text": "Never eaten here so this review is literally only for the Octoberfest  event they host.\n\nOne word...fun!  Tons of authentic german music and lots of happy smiley people dancing around and having a ball eating brats and red cabbage.  That's the scene here.  I've been 2 years running and I'm a fan for life.\n\nIt can get expensive and note they only take cash.  I had 4 liters of beer (2 people) and 2 brats w/red cabbage and it was $65.  Wow...kinda pricey but remember you are paying for the tents, the music and the chance to really get into the Octoberfest vibe! Can't even begin to describe this place.  First off, the house itself is incredible.  A throwback to craftsmanship construction and not a detail left unattended.  \n\nRegarding the food, there's not another place in Charlotte that can even come close to it in my opinion.  We were here celebrating and decided on the Chef's Tasting menu which is a 9-course dinner and I'm not going to belabor you all with the details of each and every dish.  I'll just say that the dishes were thoughtful, creative and cooked to perfection with the touch of a culinary artist.\n\nThe service was impeccable and not once did we feel rushed to finish or hurry along.  When you reserve here, you basically have the table for the night and that's a good thing because our dinner was over the span of 3 hours (slightly more).  We did chat it up a bit with the staff though.\n\nParking is valet only and is directly behind the house.\n\nBottom line, McNinch is a must do for locals and people visiting alike. Love Al Mike's! I love the daily specials that almost always include a fantastic salad and just the other day an authentic Cuban sandwich.  The decor is a mix between old school pub and cozy restaurant.  I've been here several times and seem to always get a salad because they normally do their salads with a spinach leaf base, throw in some pasta for good measure and top it off with fantastic grilled chicken.  \n\nIt's a little off the beaten path which can be a breath of fresh air from the places to eat lunch or dinner down Tryon Street.  It looks to be built from one of the renovated homes there in the neighborhood with a 'dollhouse' style exterior in my opinion.  Cool character for a restaurant.\n\nOne thing to note is that it's a bit dark in there because there isn't any overhead lighting or if there is, it's very minimal.  So if you sit back towards the back prepare to eat by candlelight (even at lunch).  The only windows are towards the front so that's why. Here for a birthday dinner for my fiance and having been to a few other Morton locations I knew what I was in store for.  And that is delicious steaks, insane deserts and outstanding service.  At least those are the things I always walk away from the place remembering.\n\nThis location is no different, great staff and comfortable atmosphere to relax with no rush to dining.\n\nThe parking is pretty non existent here so I suggest valet. First off, the atmosphere here is kind of lacking for weekdays since Epicenter has kind of stole the show and this location is somewhat off the beaten path uptown in terms of being so far down Tryon street.  But sometimes you just want somewhere that's laid back, not crowded and has the feel of local pub.  The interior is all hardwoods, there is an upstairs that I think is held for private parties maybe, or just overflow during the weekends.  They have pool tables and of course plenty of TV's for sporting events, etc.  Plenty of dining area as well surprisingly due to the fact it doesn't seem that large when you first walk in but most of the dining area is tucked away near the back of the place. \n\nOk, I've been here a few times, mostly for social gathering and drinks mainly but last night I actually ordered food.  I had The Black Forest sandwich.  It's a simple sandwich really, but they make it perfection!  I'll have to say, a great sandwich is only as good as the bun or bread it's made of.  This one is angelic...hahaha...ok....yeah it's good though.  They use a Bavarian pretzel roll (nicely warm and soft) as the bun.  The combination of the flavor of the bun combined with the great ham, monterey jack cheese, smoked bacon and honey mustard condiment is sandwich bliss.  My side item were there nacho chips and unfortunately all I have to say about those in comparison to the sandwich is.....meh.  They were fine, but nothing to get excited about.\n\nNow, in terms of specials, Tuesday nights is $2.00 draft nights (mostly domestic labels only).  Also they have a rewards program here and it's called the All Star Brew Club I believe.  You earn points for the beer you buy and at certain thresholds you get things like, money credited to your bill, free t-shirt, etc.  It's free to join and they give you $5 off your next order.....that's a WIN in my book :)", "user_id": "ts7EG6Zv2zdMDg29nyqGfA", "business_id": "2_0P2AmSSFtPgddio0MgYA"}
{"text": "Driving around Pineville at night, you're in Close Encounters - on this dark, twisty road and all of a sudden BAM the bright lights of some delicious Germanic Castle shine bright in the eyes.  \n\nInside, it's a mix - diner meets hall, flags and Spaten gear everywhere. Most importantly - this is the only place in CLT to get a full liter of delicious, German beer. 10 bucks. Reasonable. Even Erk's huge paws get dwarfed by such a stein.\n\nI figured eating here would be spatzle only - fine, I'll have more bier - but no, there's actually a sweetly-done entree to be had - veggies wrapped in puff pastry, sliced, sauced with red pepper puree that had a creamy, somehow sharp bite. $13 makes it a tad pricey, and dinner entrees climb from that. Latkes (er, whoops) were lovely - croquettes as well. Kasespatzle on the kiddie's menu rounded out our carb party and was super-enjoyable - sliced thin, like linguine, seeking a Fettucine Alfredo-style dish - I like mine more dumpling, but still satisfying.  \n\nPretzal rolls? Hot mustard? Huge booths? Great service. OMB's Dunkel on tap, along with the big hits - Franziskaner (light AND dark, huzzah), Bitte burger, Warsteiner, Weihenstephaner. \n\nWish it was closer. (repost - since I'd originally had this under Andrew Blair's, and I confuse two-named things constantly)\n\nWeird. I feel like I ate at a totally different place than every other reviewer. Maybe ABs gets flustered when they try to put on their fancy-pants for Restaurant Week.\n\nYeah, it's a little faux-pub, a little fratty, but there are only two TVs (god, my standards are dropping) and the food is cheap. What did I get? The nachos. What will I probably get every time I come? Said nachos. No art, no pretention - fried flour tortillas dusted with something aromatic and carefully smothered with black beans, cheese, tomatoes, and (tehehe) lettuce shreds we'll just go ahead and call chiffonade. Simple, textural, good. For 7 bucks. Jalapenos needed, my spicy friends, so ask. The size of your head, this pile, no, torso.\n\nIt's 1994 up in this joint, and they don't give a damn - but it limits the veg selections. I can respect the beer list, and the service was quietly good. Darkish lighting. I had a feeling in the pit of my stomach underneath the 5 pounds of nacho that the place swims in RL polos and Sperrys on the wkends (and this is before I perused other yelper's thoughts on the subject) but for Monday night nosh, it competently hit the spot. With Dave all the way (well, except for the fish part) on this dark, classy, leather-encrusted Irish Pub. I hadn't been here in years and was kind of amazed how much it resembled pre-fire Ri Ra's. And yup, something about the atmosphere here (and in most other Pubs) puts me immediately at ease.\n\nThe game seemed to have them a bit frazzled, but you could also tell they were trying pretty hard. There isn't a TV for every 10 degree turn of the head, so that's a plus. Food is more interesting on the weekends, as they offer Irish brunch dishes - my Irish Benedict (1st try having gotten consumed by a table pal after arriving with rashers, a thick, ham-like meat) was good, with the potato cakes stealing the show. I'd come back on a non-World Cup weekend for this dish, absolutely.\n\nBloody Mary was meh, but it had a huge pickle spear as a garnish. Hard to be angry at a drink that comes with a pickle.\n\nFor me, Ri Ra's is a better place to hit off-hours with friends, all of us squished into a booth, talking about Ulysses. But its' sports bar alter-ego is definitively what pays the bills.", "user_id": "7ewE_dDxjXNppOj0EhhMIQ", "business_id": "2_0P2AmSSFtPgddio0MgYA"}
{"text": "Jason's Deli is the jam when it comes to fresh sandwiches overflowing meat and toppings.  I'm always blown away by the selection of fresh meats, cheeses, and bread and the combinations that the cheerful staff point clueless folks to.  .\n\nVEGETARIANS BEWARE: YOU WILL BE APPALLED BY WHAT I WILL SAY NEXT.  Like Todd W. says, the roast beef sandwich is awesome.  I've had it twice and I can honestly say its the best roast beef sammie I can recall.  It's not like that grey matter they serve at Arby's.  No, its pink at the core, moist and pilled 1-inch thick on bread.  The sides are equally appealing, like the homemade-tasting potato salad.The portions alone make this place stand out-think McAllister's on steroids\n\nThe salad bar looked incredibly fresh as well.  In fact, the whole establishment looks fresh.  Yes, you get free muffins and ice cream.  But don't let them spoil your appetite-their sandwiches alone will bust your gut.  For around $8, you will leave Jason's Deli fat and happy. Alexander Michael's is a hidden gem in the 4th Ward.  It's rare to see restaurants uptown remain open for 27 years, but you'll quickly find out why.  Its a pub with the charm of the Cheers bar (in a converted 100 yr. old house) and food that cannot be called \"grub\".\n\nI visited last week and felt immediately welcome in this cozy tavern. Despite the busyness of that night, we were served promptly  The server was quite friendly; she offered suggestions of her fav dishes and the most commonly ordered ones.  After seeing the positive reviews for the London Broil sandwich, I opted for this sandwich with onion rings.  .   The London Broil sandwich was moist and bursting with flavor, like it was slow cooked.  The onion rings tasted homemade.  My friend ordered the copious bread pudding dessert and found it quite tasty as it was covered in caramel sauce.\n\nI think Alexander Michael's exudes \"chill\" and this is what is so attractive about it.  The clientele was young and old; it neither felt like a country club or a college sports bar.  The TV's (though they show sporting events) don't distract from conversation like most sports bars and though there is a bar, I didn't see folks getting hammered on well drinks and PBR.  Great place to bring friends of all ages and family if they are visiting Charlotte. Tried the bread pudding this weekend...PHENOMENAL!!!  Its a hot, sweet, gooey, cinnamon-flavored bread covered with caramel and two heaping dollops of whip cream.  Its a large portion, so be sure to leave room or invite a friend (preferably ME!!!). Ri Ra is pretty decent Irish pub in Uptown: dark wood dining area, Catholic saints and Irish blessings abound, and hearty Irish-inspired dishes on the menu.  It's a great place to get lunch or dinner if you like the Irish pub experience, but don't attempt to get that experience on a weekend night.\n\nYou should be warned that the atmosphere changes drastically after the 9 o'clock hour.  The place gets packed on the weekends for the live music, with many young collegiates upstairs looking for potential mates and swarming in unbridled testosterone. Rira's has good cover and local bands, in which case they charge $5-$8 cover.  Don't get wrong, this can be fun in small doses.  Outside of these times, its usually a sedate, older white collar crowd that frequents this place. \n\nFood wise-the burgers are always a good bet and the portions are quite generous.  I've had the sheperd's pie before, it definitely a \"stick to your ribs\" dinner.  Most entrees are in the $10-$20 range.  The bevvy selection is varied and lean towards British/Irish varieties. The staff are congenial, though hurried on every occasion I've been.  Rira's is a good bet among Uptown restaurants, but nothing that warrants a 5-star review.", "user_id": "fzu9zwLQJBW8RqoqADOXiw", "business_id": "_Bz6YWNI5bi0gqQI4GLvqQ"}
{"text": "I haven't been to this place  in a VERY LONG time. Years ago, this was a regular spot. I remembered the room was dark, food was good, and the infamous pole in the lady's room. So on a recent cold winter night, while Melissa & I were trying to figure out where to eat, knowing this is her regular spot, I said Alexander Michael's!\n\nParking is always a challenge. Luckily we got a spot down the road off the side street. However the darkness is a little creepy... I feel like I need a buddy system to park there (find a friend, hold hands, and walk together like we were in grade school).  The embiance was perfect for a cold night with the lit candles and closely spaced seatings. We got a table very quickly, but that's as much service as we got that night. There wasn't any incident. The waitress wasn't rude, but she just wasn't there. For a small place like this, it should be pretty easy to take good care of every table.  \n\nThe food was ok as well. I ordered the london broil sandwich with the soup as side. I forgot the \"crab\" soup was made with fake crab, which I think should be illegal to be called crab. My sandwich had enough meat on it that I pretty much just ate all the meat, which was average. Tender enough, not too much taste to it.  I guess for $9.50 I couldn't complain. Years later, I felt that their menu was limited, a little overpriced, and seems to be lacking a spark in general with food and service.\n\nI will give it a 2nd chance and visit again, maybe not anytime soon. I dragged my friend out to Morton's for their bar menu last Friday. I often miss out on happy hour deals due to my work schedule, so I was eager to check this happy hour out on my weekday off. To my surprise, Morton's offer their bar menu and drink specials from Open to Close Sunday to Friday!\n\nThey had a list of bar bites available for $8. We selected the Filet Trio & Crab Cake BLT sliders. We also each had a cocktail for $8.50 each - all & all make this a good bargain at one of the top restaurants in town.\n\nNow - the reason for my 3-stars... I understand we were not spending big bucks, but the fact that we requested medium rare on the filet, it came out more like well done and the bartender simply said it was impossible to cook a small filet piece medium rare bothered me. I realize that the bar bite dish consisted of 3 small pieces of filet - but if it is a challenge to cook medium rare on that particular dish they should have said so when I made the request. I have issues with steakhouse not coming close to the temperature I requested, worse when they didn't even bother to pretend they cared. Good thing it was $8.\n\nOverall the food was ok - the filet trio came with 3 different sauces and the blue cheese butter was the clear winner. The crab cake BLT was good as well. It is a good spot for a cheap bite at the bar. Let's be specific... \n\nI'm a fan of Ri Ra because one of my favorite cover band plays here often... and it's a nice low key joint for the most part.  \n\nNo I'm not a fan of the super crowded nights when crazy drunken young men can get into fights just because the other person took a breath.  \n\nRecently I went there with a group of friends on our little 5th Street bar crawl night.  And I have become a fan of their curry fries!  \n\nSomething addictive about a box of HOT fries mixed with a sweet yet savory curry sauce.  I don't think it's because it's late night and we've been drinking... or that I didn't have dinner (though I'm sure it has something to do with it), but I think I licked the box!\n \nI'm not sure how curry fries are Irish, but I'm glad someone think that they are.", "user_id": "M-TwsqjrGVH9-qyw2KcvdQ", "business_id": "ePP0Eqz8JKSbtdt2phiB4A"}
{"text": "Okay, I know this is just an IHOP, so I shouldn't expect culinary excellence.  \n\nBut.\n\nWe've been to this location a couple times.  They do breakfast VERY well.  Their coffee is always fresh and hot.  Their pancakes are always fresh and hot.  Their orange juice is never too tart, never too sweet.  I've never found foreign items in my food.  Wait staff is always courteous and helpful.\n\nBut.\n\nBeware - when you order NON-breakfast items, you may not end up with a satisfying meal.  This past weekend I took my daughter and my grandmother to the IHOP for a quick & cheap post-church lunch.  My grandmother ordered coffee and a belgian waffle - she said it was very delicious.  My daughter got the baby cakes kids meal, and she ate most of it.  I made the mistake of ordering the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and corn on the side.  The chicken fried steak was so tough as to be inedible (I took a couple bites and left the rest).  The mashed potatoes had clearly been in that serving bowl since the morning.  I took one bite and when I realized I was eating aged potatoes, I left the rest.  The corn was the best thing on the plate.  Needless to say when we got home I made myself a sandwich since I didn't really get lunch at the IHOP. *lol*\n\nAs I said, we've been to this location before, and they definitely do breakfast right (which makes sense given what an IHOP is).  My daughter and grandmother were very satisfied with their meals.  But stick with the breakfast menu.  Don't venture anywhere near the non-breakfast menu.  Then you should be fine. I discovered Soho Bistro a few years ago by complete accident.  I typically only go a couple times a year, but it never disappoints!\n\nLast night I popped in for dinner by myself.  The wait staff was very prompt and friendly.  I opted to order two things: scallion pancakes and their pineapple/chicken rice dish.  Most Chinses places here in NC/SC do not offer scallion pancakes (which is a travesty because I LOVE THEM).  When I told the server how much I missed them since moving here from NY, she laughed and said the owners were from NY.  No wonder they are on the menu!  They came out fresh and hot, and while they were prepared differently than expected (there wasn't as much scallion flavor as I hoped for) they were still delicious and easily enough for two people. They are about $4 on the menu.\n\nBut it's the pineapple chicken dish I want to talk about.  When the server came out with my food, I found myself facing a HUGE plate of steaming, aromatic food.  Easily enough food for three people, I found myself wolfing down perfectly cooked rice, tasty bits of chicken, and huge pieces of pineapple.  Had I been going home after the meal I'd have had more than enough to cover BOTH lunch and dinner today.  Since I wasn't going straight home, I ate way more than I should have - but with a smile on my face the entire time.  The dish was only about $9 on the menu.  \n\nThe restaurant has a pleasing, simple decor.  They do not serve liquor - only beer and wine.  The prices are outstanding considering the portions you get.\n\nAs I said, I don't get to go there often, but when I get the chance, I always enjoy it. I last reviewed Soho Bistro in mid-2011, and last night my young daughter and I popped in there for dinner before a show.  I thought I'd provide an updated review!\n\nThe place is still awesome.  The atmosphere is still peaceful and quiet, and the wait staff efficient and polite.\n\nWe ordered four items off the menu: scallion pancakes, crab wontons, tangerine chicken and sesame shrimp.  The scallion pancakes were just as good as they ever were.  The crab wontons were a bit disappointing - we were expecting something closer to crab Rangoon (based on the description) but these are more grainy than creamy.  The filling almost looked like cous cous or quinoa.  Despite this, we ate all but two of them, so they were still good.\n\nMy tangerine chicken was OUTSTANDING.  From first bite to last, it was delicious and is my new favorite thing.  My daughter's sesame shrimp was also delicious (she let me have a bite) although she thought it was a little too sweet.\n\nStaff was quick to refill drinks throughout the meal, and our total bill for dinner was $38 - a relative bargain considering we had two appetizers, two entrees and multiple refills on my daughter's soda.  \n\nI continue to recommend this place for good Chinese food at a great price.

{"text": "I recently moved to the Uptown area and have been frantically trying to experience every bar and restaurant the city has to offer to find my \"go-to\" joint. We were \"tipped off\" by a fellow Charlottinian about Alexander Michael's, and were intrigued by the directions he gave us to get there. \"You're not far from it. Off the beaten path. Shortcut through the shrubs.\" I already liked it. \n\nOnce we found the shortcut, we immediately smelled the food and followed our noses. It is tucked away in a residential area and if the food didn't smell so good you might walk right by it. We sat at the bar and needed to pull the candle closer in order to read the menu. If you take anything from this review let it be this: Honey. Garlic. BBQ Wings. YUM.\n\nI ordered the veggie burger as my main and was expecting nothing exciting, since most restaurants serve the usual warm-on-the-outside-cold-in-the-middle-sad-excuse-for-a-meal hockey puck. I was surprised that it was not only excellent and flavorful, but clearly home made. They had a great selection of micro-brewed beers in addition to the usual suspects, so my fiancee was happy from the moment we sat down. Laid back, fun and low-key, we definitely found our go-to joint. Oh, and ladies, watch out for the pole in the bathroom. You'll thank me later. Hmmm..... where to start with this one. I'll go with atmosphere, which was the good part. Cool sports bar, pool tables and ample flat screens. Now for the not so good. Our bartender was a disaster- I rarely will ever say that, I used to be one myself and understand that sometimes you can get overwhelmed, or whatever other benefit of the doubt I normally give. But this was pretty bad. We sat at the bar with only a handful of other people, so it's not even like it was busy. We told her were were going to eat and needed menus. My finacee asked for a Sunset Wheat beer, which was on tap. We weren't paying attention to her as she poured, but once he sipped the beer he immediately knew it was a Sam Adams. OK, mistake. But when we looked over at the taps, the two were no where near each other. We flagged here down when she returned to the bar (she kept disappearing) and she apologized, went to pour the correct beer and only got a half a glass out of it. Just a minute, she promised. \n\nLiterally, like 15 minutes later, she finally came back but then ran off again before we could tell her we were ready to put in our food order. We were starving! We finally flagged here down and placed the order. Good thing we ordered when we did, because the food took forever to come out!! By the time we got it we were SO hungry. I ordered the Mahi Mahi over rice, and I wouldn't have finished it if I wasn't starving - the Mahi was really dry, and they added so much spice to the dish that whatever flavor was there was killed. Granted, it is a sports bar, but I've worked in Sports bars before that served amazing fish dishes. If it's not going to be good, it shouldn't be on the menu. After flagging the bartender down (again), we finally got our bill and decided that we definitely would not be back to eat, but maybe just for drinks. Have you ever been to a sports bar where there is no games on? Enough said. If I must give you more reason why you can skip this place, the food is completely commercialized and forgettable, and the there is not a whole lot going on here.

{"text": "My intention was to get back to Sweet Tea's today, but they are closed on Sundays. So, being in that area, my Mother wanted the Chinese Chicken Salad at Applebee's, one of her all time favorites. Not being a true fan of chains, I agreed. And, I was very impressed. I ordered a cheeseburger w/ fries. The burger was cooked perfectly and fresh! I also really enjoyed their seasoned fries. My Mom enjoyed her salad as well, and the staff was attentive throughout the entire meal. Shocked, yes, but happy I said yes. So it has been a while since I have been to Ri Ra's and now I remember why. \n\nWe stopped in for drinks and appetizers, for a going away party for a collegue at work. We arrived shortly after 5:00pm and were able to grab two tables in the back, which was nice.  With more than 10 people we required a server, to sit at the table. That seemed good, rather than having to order each drink at the bar.  However, our server was taking care of every other table in the back room and drinks at the bar so he was hard to find. Most of use decided to order our next drink half way through our first since we knew it would take a while to see that next drink.\n\nAs for food, they no longer offer happy hour specials so we ordered a few appetizers off of the menu, potato cakes, poutine, cajun crab cakes, fried pickles among a few. And, all were nothing to write home about. The poutine actually came with raw french fries of which we had to send back. And the gravy, that typically is poured over the fries, sat the bottom of the bowl and tasted like gravy out of the packet, thank you McCormick's for letting Ri Ra use your gravy mix...Nasty!\n\nAs for the drinks, steer clear of the martini's, $12 for something the size of shot glass. Not worth it.  I will give credit to the fact that they did split each check and they were all correct.\nOverall, great atmosphere to get together with friends but not my first choice and not sure I would return anytime soon. So, we decided to enjoy Soho today, during the lunch rush, ugh! The place was very crowded, but as others mentioned the service is definitely quick, a little too quick.  We all chose different entrees, which included rice, white, brown, or fried, and a spring roll. I ordered the Chicken & Shrimp with vegetables, and fried rice. The spring roll was a little disappointing, no real filler.  As for the veggies and chicken, delish, but skimpy on the baby shrimp, will pass on that option next time. And, unfortunately I was given brown rice, or maybe it was fried, if so, not great, and on the colder side. Overall, it is a quick lunch, with good prices, but nothing stood out in my mind. I was looking for a new sushi spot, but was somewhat disappointed with the experience. First, I was the only customer, during my entire dining experience..which somewhat scares me. I was seated and served a complimentary salad. The salad was good, but overdressed..crazy overdressed. I ordered the onion soup and egg rolls. The onion soup was basically broth with a few onions, but no real onion flavor, which is what I was hoping for. As for the egg rolls, can I say frozen.\nOnto the sushi. I chose a roll based on the waitresses recommendation, however it had a mango sauce that was so overwhelming I sent it back. I was not offered anything else and was charged for the roll, $13.95, after eating only two pieces. I questioned the server about being charged and she expressed the fact she told me what I was getting and I ordered it. Whoa, was I surprised. I expressed my disappointment and said please do what you need to do. She disappeared and came out with an older women. Upon returning to my table she did remove the roll, but was very unpleasant about it. \nAlthough I appreciate the fact they removed the roll, but was not impressed otherwise and will stick to my other favorites.", "user_id": "do-fO-EruYVP_FQPMNWmZg", "business_id": "DE_11y6_vCmPBlbeYskh-Q"}
{"text": "My partner took me to Alexander Michael's last night for dinner.  When he lived in Uptown, he used to frequent the restaurant often, but it was my first time.  You could say I got my cherry popped.  Alexander Michael's is tucked away from the Uptown skyscrapers in the residential section.  You probably wouldn't see it unless you knew it was there.  It looks like it could be just another house on the quiet street.  There are no big signs for it and not a lot of discernable noise from the outside.  \n\nOnce we got inside, though, we saw that it was quite packed.  We were lucky to get seated right away in the crowded room that resembled something of an English or Irish pub.  The lighting was low and the casually dressed crowd was \"older\" than a lot of Uptown bars, so we felt like we fit in with the 30- and 40-somethings. \n\nWe started with a Woodchuck Cider (not everyone carries ciders!) and it was sweet, bubbly, and refreshing.  We enjoyed that our server wasn't overly attentive, but she was there whenever we needed to order and checked up on us only when necessary.  I tried the blackened catfish and my partner had the honey chicken.  Both were delicious.  Mine (accompanied by spicy black beans) had just the right amount of cajun flavor.  And the portion sizes were just right -- not enough to overfill you, but not enough to leave you hungry when you left.  \n\nIt was definitely an enjoyable experience, and I look forward to returning to this new (to me).  The only disappoint is that we weren't able to see the famous pole that they talked about on the back of the menu.  It's located in the women's restroom and apparently it's caused quite a few bruises.  Funny! I was in Uptown for an all-day meeting and looking for someplace to go on my lunch break.  I decided to give Matt's Chicago Dog a try because I've always noticed the crowds, I love hot dogs, and I love Chicago (I'm a sucker for marketing).  \n\nThe menu was a lot more extensive than I was expecting and I felt a bit overwhelmed, like being the new kid coming into a school halfway through the year.  Everyone walking in knew what they wanted and how to order.  I, on the other hand, felt like I had to go back to Ordering Food 101.  The guy behind the counter was very friendly and accommodating, though, and walked me through the process.  I still felt stupid, but at least I got to order.  \n\nFinding a place to sit was the biggest challenge.  The place fills up during lunch.  Luckily, hot dogs (and other similar items) are usually quick to eat, so people don't stay seated for very long.  The atmosphere doesn't pretend to be a place for \"hanging out\" and talking anyway, so you want to eat and go.  \n\nThe people working there definitely have a good process, but you still have to wait a little while for your food, as everything's freshly made.  And with the menu and the list of toppings being so extensive, no two things coming out are probably alike.  \n\nI got my polish sausage and fries in good time, though, and enjoyed them immensely.  I just wish we had someplace like Matt's near MY workplace, as I'd like to try a lot more on the cheaply priced menu! I like Rock Bottom.  It's in a great location Uptown and offers a good American menu in a nice, casual setting.  I can always count on great food and great service.   If you want a \"light\" meal, they have an abundance of salads to choose from.  I'm working my way through each of them, but I haven't had a disappointing one yet and they're each very filling.  If I'm a little hungrier or craving a hot meal, I tend to go with the Blue Crab Stuffed Chicken or the Hazelnut Crusted Chicken.  Mmm... they're both melt-in-your-mouth good.  Then I usually wash them down with whatever brewed-on-the-spot beer they have on special, preferably something light.  \n\nRock Bottom is a good place to take eaters that don't like to experiment with gourmet food (but you can still find something gourmetish yourself!), out-of-town guests, or even a date for a nice, casual get-to-know-you meal in nice surroundings without any pretension.  It can even serve as a great standby if everything else Uptown is too crowded or you can't decide where to eat.

{"text": "On Thursday, Aug. 18th, I had the pleasure of visiting Alexander Michael's for dinner.  This was probably the fifth or sixth time I have eaten at this local neighborhood gem, and I can assuredly tell you, this Alexander Michael's experience was just as good as the first.\n\nMy date and I walked in pleasantly surprised that despite the warm, quiet, lazy, summer evening outside, Alexander Michael's was cool, dark, and very lively on the inside.  We were directly escorted to a table in the cozy restaurant, just behind the bar.  \n\nMy date ordered the chicken pita with fries (I've taken a picture of it), I ordered the craw fish bake (see pic).  The bake was a cross between a shrimp pasta and a seafood casserole.  It was perfectly gooey and cheesy - but not heartstoppingly so.  As for my date's pita; she loved it.  I had a few bites and can attest to its legitimacy.  Both OUR MEALS WERE EXCELLENT!!  \n\nI am truly of fan of this elegant and intimate Charlotte jewel. To me, Alexander Michael's is a place where you can get elegant, all-american bar food, but with an upscale twist.  If you haven't been to Alexander Michael's - GO!  If you've already been, GO AGAIN!! I went to the famed Rock Bottom the other night, Friday Dec. 2, 2011 to celebrate a good friend's birthday.  We ended up getting there around 7:45pm on a Friday night to find the place very alive with people, both young and old, carousing, socializing and being merry.  \n\nMy friends and the party I was attending were stationed in the bar area, to the left as you walk in.  Though there was a jumble of people standing around drinking and talking, a server promptly noticed we were new to the scene and took our drink orders and provided us with a menu to look over.  I ordered a \"light lager\" for my girlfriend and a \"Brown Ale\" draft for myself.  Draft beers were running $4 per pint on Friday night; which certainly isn't bad, but isn't a deal by any means. \n\nAs evening turned into a chilly night, the people I was with found a few tables in the bar area and placed food orders.  I ordered, the BBQ pulled pork sliders as an appetizer, and some sort of lobster and shrimp rolled into a black corn enchiladas.  As a devout BBQ lover, I found the sliders to be an extreme disappointment.  The BBQ was border-line cold and there was very little BBQ on each of the sliders.  As for the enchiladas, the appeal of my meal was more in the uniqueness of the dish than its actual taste.  It's not that the enchiladas were bad, they just left me wanting more.  My girlfriend got the steak with mashed-potatoes and green-beans.  I thought the steak was above par.  My girl friend said it was cooked to her specifications.  \n\nOverall, I felt the food was good not great, and the BBQ sliders were not up to BBQ code.  However, Rock Bottom offered the perfect ambiance to enjoy myself and my friend's birthday in splendid fashion.  The service WAS GREAT!  I wish I could recall my server's name, because I would love to give her a shot-out.  Despite the chaotic atmosphere that reigned throughout the bar, she was prompt, polite and accurate with everything.\n\nTIPS: *Nice, classy atmosphere, *Nice seating area outside  *Parking can be found by turning either way on 7th street, including in the garage attached to Rock Bottom itself (KEEP YOUR TICKET!!  BRING IT IN WITH YOU!  ROCK BOTTOM VALIDATES PARKING, SEE THE HOSTESS.)  *Stay away from the BBQ Sliders  *Great, friendly service  *Good for parties or pre-gaming before going out somewhere else", "user_id": "dQ3fXZETKfst-aJ2zBdtOw", "business_id": "ePP0Eqz8JKSbtdt2phiB4A"}
{"text": "Schnitzel bonanza! I came here with my family for a nice German time, plus I was craving for a schnitzel for months since I came from San Fran. Inside the ambiance is very lets say, German feeling (not that I've been to Germany... But from pictures I can imagine, right?) high ceilings and wooden support beams cover this restaurant. The wooden beams are Covered with fliers of Spaten German beer which gives a feeling of Germany party feeling.\n\nSo let's get to the food. I got schweitzer schnitzel (I believe) which is breaded pork stuffed with swiss cheese and ham. It was delicious (but I think San Fran still has it for me). Inside there was black forest ham, which gave it an extra touch of it and it oozed out Swiss cheese.\n\nOther dishes were pork tenderloin and pan fried ham of pork topped with an egg. They didn't think it was bad because it was healthy and wasn't too oily nor salty. \n\nFor dessert we ordered some ice cream with peach schnapps topped with raspberry. It was okay, the raspberry had a hint of sourness but at the same time the ice cream balanced the sour taste. It was an interesting combination.\n\nOverall, I felt pretty good about this restaurant considering its in Charlotte and one of the only German restaurants the city offers. They fulfilled my tummy and I will come here if I crave for schnitzels, maybe try another type of schnitzel next time. Came here for lunch, however I do want to say that I went to the deli next to the Hearst tower. It was super busy though!\n\nEach sandwich is hand made to order and it was not bad. I got the smoked salmon BLT which was actually surprisingly not bad. The prices are a little off to me, but I guess you're in the city maybe that's how it goes. This place is an in and out restaurant. Call what you want what bread you want (and make sure to say roll instead of for example wheat which is sort of just like bread) and they'll make it and you'll be out in a couple of minutes depending on how long you wait in line.\n\nThis place has pretty fresh ingredient and I would no doubt be coming here if I was working downtown. However, this place I give three stars for the wait time, the prices, and that overall it just wasn't amazing nor bad. Oh man oh man! Another review, and this time from the well known Rock Bottom in downtown Charlotte. I came here with a friend who wanted some of their beer as well as their food. And sadly, I wasn't impressed. Inside though they completely changed the outlay of the dining area from the last time I came here, which was about 2 years ago... They added ramps as well as new things to look at and admire, such as the glass between booths and some paintings. But, overall it's all the same with the looks and what not.\n\nI had two things from the menu: Fish Tacos (RB Taco) and the Southwestern Chili.\n\nNow, the good first. Southwestern Chili. It was awesome, I felt like it was very good and chunky. However, I wish the portion was just a wee bit bigger just because it was so tasty!\n\nAnother plus was the service. My friend ordered a steak and it was a little overcooked, the waiter completely understood and took it back to get another steak cooked medium rare. It was fast and I believe even the manager came up to fix the problem. They offered a soup or whatever, but my friend declined (I was wondering why he didn't get me another chili!)\n\nNow the bad. Eating the Fish Tacos was like grabbing a handful of seasoned salt and then eating it. Every single bite was just a burst of not just salt, but just sodium with a little heat kicked in, but that was probably from the amount of salt and it made it seem spicier. After drinking water, it was still stuck in my mouth. Kick back the salt Rock Bottom and pull out that flavor of the fish! After all, it is a fish taco.\n\nOverall, not bad, food is average. Service is pretty good though. Next time though, I'm sticking away from those tacos.", "user_id": "mTKWYLN9PmqF7UflA7tnPQ", "business_id": "2_0P2AmSSFtPgddio0MgYA"}
{"text": "Visiting Pittsburgh from out of town, so naturally I asked my hosts to take me to Primanti's (and they were happy to oblige).  We went to the one at \"PPG.\" The place was busy but not crowded on a Friday night.  The menu was on the wall along with murals of Pittsburgh's finest sports starts.\n\nOur server was quick and efficient and we never were in need of refills or anything else.\n\nI got the Pitts-burgher cheese steak and we tried an order of the Smallman Street Fries.  The fries were truly loaded.  The chili had a nice kick to it and there was literally an ice cream scoop of sour cream on top.  However, the fries were actually seasoned that well and were under done in my opinion.  That didn't bode well for the fries on the sandwich, but I kept my hopes high.\n\nThe sandwich comes out and its a monster.  I love the italian bread, the beef patty and cheese, the slaw was good (shredded cabbage, not like southern cole slaw).  Everything was fresh but, again, the fries were the worst part.  Underdone, underseasoned.  Definitely my least favorite part.\n\nNonetheless, I would definitely return because I want to try some of the other menu items.  I've heard double-meat is the way to go.  I'm intrigued. Stopped into Matt's yesterday around 11:55 before the noon lunch rush.  The place definitely got packed around 12:05.  It's in a strip with many good looking lunch places but I was craving a hot dog.\n\nI ordered the carolina dog combo.  Seemed like a reasonable price for an uptown lunch stop.  The food was ready pretty quickly.  The dog was a big ole mess; understanding that \"big\" and \"mess\" are good things.  I really liked the slaw and the chili had good flavor.  You got the mustard flavor in there too while still being able to taste the actual dog.  Nice blend.  The poppy seed bun was different but good.  Though, I was always prefer a toasted bun.\n\nStaff was really friendly and drove this review to 4 stars. My coworker and I stopped in here for dinner because we wanted something easy and this was across the street from our hotel.  It was pretty quiet when we arrived but busier as the night progressed.\n\nWe ordered some edamame to start.  The server recommended that we dip them in a mix of chili sauce and soy sauce.  I hadn't tried that before but I really appreciated the extra flavor punch.  \n\nI had the Soho Twin Delight which was a combo plate of Sesame Shrimp and Spicy Sha-cha Beef.  The dish was beautifully plated.  Both parts of the dish were well-seasoned.  It was served with a large pot of rice that was well-cooked.\n\nThe banter with our server was great and perfect for dinner at the end of a long day.  I'd recommend Soho Bistro for a good dinner/lunch if you're in the area. Visited Rock Bottom at about 4:45 on a Saturday.  Was surprised at how busy they were but we were still able to be seated quickly in a large comfortable booth overlooking the street.\n\nI started with the Summer Honey Ale.  Meh.  I think I was expecting a bit more of a sweet/honey flavor.  I wish I had tried one of their other beers.  It comes in a large glass (I think bigger than a typical pint serving).\n\nI had the stuffed poblano peppers.  I was curious (dubious?) so I asked my server.  She said that the filling is awesome and that the bites with the peppers had a kick.  She was spot on.  I really enjoyed the cheesey, chicken-y, chorizo-y filing.  The rice around the peppers was good too and it definitely seemed like a hearty portion.  Eventually, with sweat running down the side of my face, I scraped the remaining filling out of the second pepper and just ate it.  I enjoyed my pepper bites but was ready to stop the heat.\n\nOur group shared some of the ice cream sandwiches.  Childish?  Yes.  Tasty?  Surely.  The plate comes with three ice cream sandwiches made with chocolate chip cookies, some strawberries, and a bowl of chocolate sauce.  My only wish was that the cookies were a bit softer.  In texture and look, they were over done with just lent additional difficulty to eating the messy treat.\n\nOur server was very good and took excellent care of us.", "user_id": "YoH_CyMmem-JOEMyEhU2Sg", "business_id": "NeUf9FyCCIN4MEseNyqkXQ"}
{"text": "Came out for an last minute lunch with my guy before heading into work today and this was on the way. We had soup salad and breadsticks ya know the norm for an olive garden lunch as well as the Mediterranean flatbread. Everything was unexpectedly delicious for such a large chain.  The flatbread had a very generous amount of toppings peppers artichokes and olives and the bread sticks were super fresh and the minestrone soup was loaded with veggies beans and noodles. The salad was good as always they really do have tasty dressing. \n\nThe service was great we sat at the bar as we mostly do wherever we go. She was super attentive we wanted for nothing and everything came out quickly and there was no wait even given the busyness of the lunch hour. \n\nPlenty of parking and easily accessible being in front of the Carolina place mall. They are great for groups and kids lunch and dinner. Came here the other night with my guy after going out on a long planned date night to the hornets spurs game. Originally after the game we had planned on going to our old faithful Thomas street tavern, but we were to tired to continue drinking and just wanted food and bed. Most things were closing up that I suggested along the way until we came upon Rock Bottom. I had never been there and neither had he so we were excited to try something new. \n\nTo be honest the whole experience started out wrong so I probably should have gone with my instincts and left right away. We sat ourselves in the bar area we could tell that was the only section open and well no one had come to seat us so sat we did. the server whos name ill keep out of this just because I believe people have bad days and sometimes you cant hide it even at work it happens to the best of us. however she was extremely short and the general impression we received was that she would rather not only be doing anything but serving us but that she genuinely didn't like us for whatever reason. She started by asking if we had been there before we said no she went over the fact that they were a brewery and what would we like to drink. We sampled one of their house beers that was on special that night. I said it was ok and that I would rather have a mixed drink. My guy asked if they had OMB copper on tap, she retorted \"no were a brewery we don't have other peoples beer here!\" ..... uh ok well then why is miller lite and Newcastle on tap right behind you I ask.. she said well we have a few I guess.... ok...... we then went over the menu and my guy ordered a ribeye well done (much to my dismay and whining about why he was ruining a perfectly good steak... I'm working on him)  I ordered the salmon.   About 5 minutes later our server returns to inform me that they had not necessarily run out of salmon but that at that point in the night they had already put it away (they didn't close for another hour or more) and that she would just get me a menu.. so I ordered a salad that sounded really good it was a smoky tomato and kale salad that I added shrimp to. when the food came out the steak was med rare (me happy my guy not so much) and my salad was a little bowl of lettuce kale and pico de gallo with some sort or spicy aioli for dressing that was really just mostly mayo. yuck. I was starving so at this point I just made do.  my guy asked the server once she came back to please put the steak back on the grill for a little longer since it was not well done. she just grabbed the plate and walked off then brought back his broccoli to eat without his steak so that \"he had something to eat while he waited\" she came back about 1 min and a half later with a steak that looked like had been gotten out of the dumpster, I mean it wasn't it was his but it had been microwaved into next year. This is not hard to tell folks and for my guy it was just an insult he cooks for a living and I served for 11 years its pretty much a huge screw you mr customer I could care less about your experience here with us.\n\nHe asked for more sauce since they microwaved it she brought it didn't say anything didn't ask how it turned out then once we asked for the check before she brought it she asked how everything was I said OK to be nice but try to get the point across she looked down at the plate she picked up rolled her eyes and walked off without another word.  A few minutes later brought the check for 50 bucks on food I would have been so much better off not eating. \n\nI know this was a long review but to end all I can say is when walking uptown and thinking about places to eat for dinner, pass this place up and try one of the other wonderful places uptown like ruths chris or capital grill.  I really wish I had just gone with Thomas street and next time given limited options well just be ordering pizza or hitting a drive through or just not eating. Everything about this place turned me off which is a shame I hate unhappy reviews.", "user_id": "y4ly5NI12DnDozJZhgm9Mg", "business_id": "4WsTFTH8GgnyFHwrH9nHzA"}
{"text": "Hadn't been to a Jason's Deli in a while, but went today for lunch as I had an errand to run near by, and I was pleasantly surprised. Maybe it was the girl at the counter who was so helpful, but in the handful of times I've been to Jason's Deli, I never had anyone tell me about the complimentary ice cream and muffins. Your choice - before or after you eat, no matter. Most people were eating while they waiting for their food to be delivered. I was in awe...ha. The roast beef sandwich was great and the portion was large...couldn't finish it all. If you're in the mood for something fast and lite, make sure to check out the self serve and self pay salad bar...and yes, the ice cream will be there for you too. In the Pineville area and need a quick breakfast meeting meal for the office? Here you go! Call ahead and within 15 minutes, your dozen bagels (sliced) and Box of Coffee is ready to go. Comes with 2 cream cheeses and the staff was very friendly about the order. Sometimes places, during breakfast, get irritated with large orders like this...not here. The place was busy and they were very helpful. The inside was larger than expected too! Since I'm on a chain review bender today, I need to add Morton's. I love Morton's, always will, and I have no doubt it will always be 5 stars for me. Yeah it's expensive, yeah it can be stuffy, but I don't care...the food is so PURE, that I will be a customer for life (ha). They've got some cheap eats in the bar and a nice TV area to watch some games too over a $15 martini :) \n\nThe Filet is awesome, as are the button mushrooms, which I had on my recent visit. The souffles are awesome and it's the best molten lava cake in town. Oh Morton's how I love thee :) Love me a hot dog; especially Chicago dog. What makes a hot dog a true Chicago dog...well let me tell you. Steamed or water-simmered, kosher-style, all-beef frankfurter on a poppy seed bun. The hot dog is topped with yellow mustard, chopped white onions, sweet pickle relish, a dill pickle spear, tomato slices, pickled sport peppers, and a dash of celery salt. NEVER, NEVER has ketchup. That's like putting ketchup on a Brat...absolute no, no :) \n\nMatt's, also located in Cornelius is great for a quick pit stop. They also have burgers, salads, Italian beef, etc. You can get everything \"Carolina style\" too if you're so inclined. Located on The Green near Aquavina. Great outdoor seating on a nice day! One of my favorite places to watch \"the game.\" On the weekends, make sure you check out the board at the front door and it will show you where your team is playing int he bar. Three levels. I prefer the downstairs by the couches when my team is playing. It allows for many different sounds going through the same bar with all the different levels and areas. Typical bar food, but it's good and the menu is in depth. There's always a drink special to indulge on game day\n\nNever been there at any other time than to watch sporting events, and probably wouldn't go otherwise, hence why the review is based on game day only. Oh Presto...how I've driven by you for 3 years and never popped in. Well thanks to a restaurant.com gift certificate we checked it out recently. First impression...where are the people? Granted it was a Monday night, so I let it be. We sat upstairs. Service was good, but my food was just ok. \n\nOrdered the Chicken Martini, which was described as chicken w/mashed potatoes and spinach. I guess I expected something different (thinking healthy for a moment), as the meal came out bathed in gravy all over everything and the chicken was breaded. My comment, was \"ooo, bummer\". The chicken was cooked nice after I scraped the gravy off. This in essence describes the majority of the menu...smothered food/cream sauces. \n\nThe calamari appetizer was good, though more than enough. Be careful not to get full on it prior to the entree. If so, think sandwich or salad for the second course.", "user_id": "whKpnugMnWTz3UjlrN71yg", "business_id": "_Bz6YWNI5bi0gqQI4GLvqQ"}
{"text": "Definitely my favorite \"neighborhood-y\" type of place in town--and, come to think of it, one of the only restaurants in town that has that sort of feel. Dark, cozy--just a really cool spot. Not far from uptown, but in a more residentially area than you'd expect. It even kinda looks like a house from the road. \n\nGreat bar scene if you're looking to meet up for a few drinks (definitely not the type of place to really meet people or get sloppy, if that's what you're looking to do), with really cool, knowledgeable bartenders. \n\nGood food, too. Last time in, I had the wings (definitely above average) and a pulled-pork sandwich, which was great. Simple, American-style food but done well, with great ingredients. \n\nDefinitely a great date place. Cool vibe and classy in an understated way--check it out! Fox and Hound is a typical southern-style bar/restaurant, which normally means it's gonna be a big hit with me. It was--kinda. Do not go for the food.  It's fine enough, but definitely not  its strongpoint. I doubt you're headed here to eat, though. Let's be honest. \n\nPeople generally come here to drink--drink and play pool, more specifically. If that's what you're after, this place is idyllic: smoky room, pool tables, tvs, and all the beers you'd like. Definitely not the most bumping scene on weekday nights, but it gets pretty crowded on Thursdays and on the weekends. Seems like a lot of banker types head here after work to unwind. \n\nIt's simple: you want a drink, you want to play pool--come on down. Ri Ra's is a popular place to go if you're up for a big (and by \"big\"  I mean wild and drunk) night out in Uptown Charlotte--that much has been well-documented. I've definitely partaken of a few of these nights. It's a nice bar, with lots of room and generally lots of fun people looking to get after it. Again, this has all been said before. \n\nWhat I wanted to write about is that Ri Ra's is a nice place to head for lunch, especially if you're downtown (or Uptown, whichever your prefer). They have a really efficient salad and sandwich line--it's conveyor belt style, where you pick your bread, your meat, your toppings etc. It's a really quick process, and so it's a good place to head if you're not sticking around, or if you're in a rush. But the food holds up--it's not bad at all. \n\nIt's right next to the Bank of America building and offers a huge plaza of outdoor seating, so its location is ideal. Especially when it's nice out. We like this place for casual lunches and dinners. It's right in the heart of downtown and it's huge--lots and lots of tables, along with a huge bar and plenty of outside seating--so it's pretty convenient for all sorts of days and times. It gets pretty crowded, especially during the lunch crunch, but because of its size, you'll never really have to wait all that long. \n\nMy girlfriend lives for their fish tacos, so if that's your thing, order away. I like their burgers and sandwiches--great club sandwich, good fish and chicken sandwiches, good reubens, great chicken finger sandwich. Roch Bottom features a lot of standard pub food, done up a little nicer than the options you'd find at most places. Though it's original, Rock Bottom has more of an Outback or Applebees feel than a pub. Not a bad thing. \n\nThey've got a great selection of beers, many of which are, obviously, their own creations. Try 'em all. They're really good. Look, there's nothing healthy for you at Bojangles--or nothing you'd order, at least. You know that going on. You're probably going to feel a little sick or regretful after your meal. You know that going in, too. But still, this place makes the tastiest, worst food. I can't help but go back time and time again, even if it's just to reward myself for good behavior. \n\nThere's a lot to love about Bojangles, this location in particular. As you'd expect, this location is super clean and, well, pretty fast; you get your food in a timely fashion, which makes the crowds less intimidating. The fries are to die for: supremely seasoned and pipin' hot. My girlfriend lives and dies by Bojangles biscuits, so be sure to grab one if you can. While their chicken sandwiches are awesome, I love their tenders too; I often combine these with a meal of mashed potatoes and/or slaw. \n\nAgain, probably the least healthy option in the world, but as far as fast food--what a tasty option.", "user_id": "kDYpTc-yc8UAxCs_LhX1yA", "business_id": "ePP0Eqz8JKSbtdt2phiB4A"}
{"text": "If I could give less than 1 star, I would.  I booked a reservation for 12 almost two weeks in advance of the date we wanted to dine.  I explained it was a going away party for a member of our team and that we wanted a large table.  I was told that would be no problem.  I was then told I had to give a credit card number to hold the table.  I questioned this as I have made numerous reservations and have never had to do this previously.  Chris stated he would not be able to hold without the information so I reluctantly gave it to him.  We arrived as a group a few minutes early for our reservation at 11:30am.  We were immediately greeted and seated as one of only two occupied tables in the entire restaurant.  The problem is that five (5) of us were at one round table and five (5) of us were at another.  We requested a different table or to push the two together.  We were told by our waiter that it was not possible to do this as the tables were not made to fit together and they had a full booking.  We had one waiter and the other table had a different waiter.  Our waiter was awful.  We had to request drink refills two separate times during our 45 minute wait on our food and he never came back to check on us once he served our food. When I eat out at a supposed \"fine dining\" establishment and pay $16 and change for a 6 ounce filet, I expect it to be superb. It wasn't.  I would have sent the dish back, but the waiter never returned.  Since it was a business group we couldn't wait another 45 minutes.  A lady at my table ordered the white bean dish and it was so salty she couldn't finish it.  Another diner at my table got the macaroni and cheese as an entree.  The noodles were under done and a bit chewy.  We requested our separate checks the next time we saw the waiter as we needed to get back to work.  When he brought the checks, they had charged us a 20% gratuity.  I asked why and was told because we were in a large party.  I explained to him that I did not feel we should have to pay the gratuity as my reservation was not honored and our service was lacking.  He said it was policy.  I asked for the manager who introduced himself as Eric.  I explained the situation to him.  Having to ask for refills, the long wait, the waiter not coming back ,etc.  He stated we are a large party and it is policy.  I told him we were treated as separate parties.  We were not seated together, did not share the same waiter and did not get served at the same time.  He refused to budge but said he would ask the owner.  I was then approached by the owner/chef.  It was apparent from the look on his face when he approached me that he was ready for battle. His opening words were, \"You got great service and great food so you should pay for it.\"  I told him the service was not great, the food was not great.  I tried to explain the situation.  He told me I should just pay my bill.  I told him we were treated as two separate parties and not seated at the same table.  He stated, \"Well, you walked in the door together.\"  I told him if the $ was that important to him, I would pay it, but that I work for a large corporation within 2 blocks of his restaurant and that I would have thought repeat business and keeping a good relationship with his diners would be worth more than that to him.  He said he didn't appreciate me threatening him (???!!??!) and for me to pay my bill and get out.  I gave the waiter my credit card assuming he meant to pay it without the gratuity, which I was more than willing to do.  When the bill came back, they had charged me the gratuity so I refused to sign it.  Another lady in my party of 5 paid her bill with a 10% tip.  The waiter brought the check back and said it was short.  She said she meant to only tip 10%.  He told her that they had had people ARRESTED FOR REFUSING TO PAY THEIR TIPS BEFORE.  She became frightened and put another $5 bill in the folder and left the restaurant.  Did I mention this lady is in her 60's?  When I refused to sign my check the manager, Eric, told me that by refusing to sign I was refusing to pay and that they would call the police.  I told him to go ahead, but wanted to see the written policy.  He told me it was on the website.   ??? Everyone checks a website before making a reservation?  Then told me it was my lucky day & they wouldn't be calling the cops, but would be taking it up with the credit card company.  Good luck.  Hope that $60 is worth the report to the BBB! ...and they're closed.  Couldn't have happened to a more deserving group of people.  Found out the chef that told me he was the owner was NOT the owner.  Found out he left less than a month after this incident.  The restaurant closed less than four months after that.

{"text": "We were taken here by a couple of locals (I guess we're locals now too though) on Wednesday night and fun was had.  It's got a busy, friendly vibe and overall satisfying food.\n\nThe good: to contradict a previous reviewer, I found the beer selection to be quite respectable.  You've got mainstream goat piss, mainstream Irish, beer snob local, national and international.  I was very pleased by the Gaelic ale from Asheville.  Very pleased.  Also, the nachos were truly a work of art.  I can't stand flour tortillas but flour tortilla chips are great for this mouthwatering mountain of peppers, beans, tomatoes, olives, cream and little chicken bits.\n\nThe ok: well, I found my pasta - the Honey Chicken - to be just ok.  The chicken itself was nice and juicy.  I don't know what I expected from the pasta.  I think it was overall a bit sweet, and perhaps a nice pungent feta topping would have broken that up a bit better. What it came with was a bland kind of Parmesan, I think.\n\nI might return and try something else on the menu - like their massive 1/2 pound burgers - and we'll see if it'll make me a fangirl. Ahhhhhh. The neon green relish. The crisp, fresh pickle and tomato. The poppyseed bun. The real Vienna beef dog... well, it was a bit soft but in general the food here to me says west 35th, 55th off the Dan Ryan, or even 95th and Ewing if you know what I mean. They've got the lingo. Fresh cut fries, pizza puffs. \nSadly the decor to me says something more like Fullerton and Clark. It's just a little too nice. I know that's a strange complaint. The tables and chairs look right, but that glass-and-brass sneezeguard and the tasteful mural... eh. Its just not tacky enough. I want to see posters of thick eyebrowed women holding up kronos gyros. \nI digress. Tasteful decor is not a dealbreaker though. I'm sure I'll be back. You definitely don't want for choices with the Rock Bottom menu.  They cover all sorts of ground in the American/Tex-Mex/Americanized Ethnic food types.  But of course, most places with big menus have lots of food that is between pretty good and pretty mediocre.  I had an okay bowl of chili, my guest had a chicken pot pie  that she did not care for.  Burgers and sandwiches are solid.  We all loved the excellent, addictive fries: they're the thin snacky types full of potatoey flavor.\nOh man and I tried the seasonal beer - a bock - which was a pretty good deal.  We figured that it was 25% more beer than the standard serving but at only 12.5% higher cost.  Anyway the brew was a knockout.  Don't drink it on an empty stomach, but do drink it. My first meal as a Charlottean was had at this establishment.  I had a taste for fish, and so was pleased to find more than a few appealing options on the dinner menu.  I opted for the trout, preceded by the classic french onion soup.  David X. had the special, a smoked salmon pasta.\n\nThe good: the trout was delightful, well complimented by potatoes and a light tomatoey sauce.  The portions were perfect, aka not too big.  Basically this dish saved the experience for me.\n\nThe ok: the bread was warm (not hot) and the salmon special was pretty good too.  Smoked salmon plus creamy sauce, yum.\n\nThe underwhelming: the french onion soup was not hot.  The cheese was not bubbling or gooey, it was a bit congealed.  Meh.  And, to echo the words of others, the service was more than just pokey.  This was a bit absurd because we were the only people eating in the restaurant.\n\nWould I come back? Maybe, to try the breakfast everyone seems to enjoy so much. Maybe they're a bit more on top of their game for breakfast/brunch.  But probably not for dinner.", "user_id": "iBmy7fYcirpA8d94EhX5RA", "business_id": "ePP0Eqz8JKSbtdt2phiB4A"}
{"text": "I had lunch at TLC Wings on a Saturday about 1 pm.  There was only one other person inside when I came in.  I ordered 10 wings, hot, and a basket of fries.  I got my drink and sat down to wait for my food.  They had a football game on the flat screen TV.   It took about 20 minutes to get my food.  The sauce on the wings was very good, typical Buffalo style sauce.  The wings themselves were a little over cooked, but still OK.  The fries were good, but they put a seasoned salt on which I would have them leave off next time.  Overall this is a nice place and I would have given a more stars, but a 20 minute wait for 10 wings and fries is ridiculous.  My recommendation, skip eating in here and order your wings to go. A pretty standard Chinese buffet.  The have a nice seafood selection, mussels, fish, shrimp, crab, etc.  I wasn't adventurous to try it but they had octopus.  They also had sushi, but I'm not a sushi fan so I didn't try it so I can't say much about it.  They also had the standard Americanized dishes too.  They did a good job of bringing out fresh food.  Like any buffet the quality is going to suffer over a sit down place, but I like the variety.  Not the greatest Chinese buffet I've ever eaten at, but China Buffet is pretty decent. I had lunch at China King.  It's pretty standard Chinese place.  The restaurant was pretty full.  The food is not made to order, but in batches which are kept in a steam table where you order.  I had the General's chicken which was $6.25 and came with an eggroll.  I'm pretty sure you can get a chicken wing instead of the eggroll  The food was hot and pretty tasty.  It satisfied my craving for Chinese.  Not much to say here really. Next time I would go for the chicken wing instad of the eggroll which was kind of soggy after sitting around.  If you want inexpensive fast Chinese food then try the China King, but don't expect much more than inexpensive, fast, Chinese. I've been  back to China King a couple of times now since my initial visit.  I came earlier around 11 to 11:30 is and it was not busy at all.  I ordered off their specials menu, Spicy Pork & the next visit Sa Cha Chicken, $5.99 for entree, rice & choice of egg roll or chicken wing.  Both were pretty good.  Again nothing outstanding, but pretty tasty.  I order a chicken wing as side both times to try them out.  The flavor is excellent, but again they were a little soggy from being left on their steam table for a while.  I also had soup on both visits since it is getting colder out now.  Egg drop the first time, then hot & sour the second.  Both soups were pretty good and you can get some crunchy noodles to go with it.    Since I keep returning I'm upping my rating to 4 stars.  This place is kind of growing on me and the food has been consistently hot and flavorful on each of my visits.  Don't expect anything fancy here, but they do have pretty good Chinese food here. I went to Mert's for lunch based off the reviews here and recommendations from coworkers.  I wasn't disappointed.  Mert's has an atmosphere that is trying to look like a dive diner, but comfortable and clean as well.  The atmosphere works well here.   I ordered the jumbo chicken wings with greens and mac-n-cheese as my sides.  The chicken wings were big and fried crispy, the greens were very tasty as was the mac-n-cheese.  The cornbread has to be some of the best I have ever had.  The greeens and mac-n-cheese were not the best I have ever had, but they were right up towards the top of my list.  The place was fairly busy as I expected and the service was OK.  I recieved my drink and food promptly, but my server never checked back.  I never really needed anything so I didn't suffer, but I can't give 5 stars because of that.  If you like good home cooked goodness then Mert's is the place to go.", "user_id": "GZPmUmnnH7rx3xUzF5vqwQ", "business_id": "lX3XYcMWoRlHjrmkoGNefQ"}
{"text": "I don't know why I never visited Matt's Chicago Dogs before seeing I work a few blocks away from there and everything on their menu looks delish.  So many hot dog selections and combinations to get I was in information overload. Being a first timer I though it was appropriate got the Chicago Style Dog combo. I've never had a hot dog topped with peppers and tomatoes before so that was a bit funky.....but good kinda funky. \n\nAs others have said, the fries were mushy and soft but I am equal opportunity when it comes to fried potatoes and will eat whatever you put in front of me. $6 something for a lunch combo with side (fries or chips) and drink (free refills-holla!) is a great deal in my eyes and you can eat outside if the weather is nice. When I went in for a refill, I noticed the Wunder Bar---chocolate covered cheesecake on a stick. I will most definitely be back for that after another tasty dog. I go here maybe once or twice a year since they have a BOGO coupon in the Citipass book but that's really the only thing enticing me to go. They have a nice patio area where you can sit back, relax, people watch and enjoy some humdrum food. Only complaint-random, crazy people screaming about Jesus and the noise from the Gold Rush and other CATS buses. Last time I went, our server was very sweet but it took almost 30 minutes for our lunch to make it out. I ordered a chicken sandwich and french fries-were they killing the chicken in the back?? I kept watching servers go by with other peoples food, practically salivating over the plates of french fries since I gave it up for Lent and just wanted one fry to make me happy. Thank God I didn't order their fish tacos (which I've heard are fantastic) because they probably would have had to go catch the fish to make it)\n\nI heard they validate parking which is a pretty nice touch if you don't live or work in the Uptown area. You have to park in the parking deck either below or on the side of RB.\n\nI like it for after work drinks as well but besides that, as Stephen K said, easy to enjoy and easy to forget. Wow, not a lot of one stars in my review history so here we go......Salsarita's was the first \"Mexican\" place I tried when I moved to Charlotte....from Phoenix. Needless to say, I had high expectations, even if it was a step above Taco Bell. My first experience was absolutely horrible--I ordered a burrito which was cold, wet and dripping some kind of funky juice. Gross.\n\nI went there a number of times after my initial bad experience and all I can think is no. I went there solely because for awhile were no other Mexican food options Uptown close to me and they offer a number of coupons in the Citpass book. But I've always been disappointed there, even up to last wk when I went there for the last time ever. Maybe it's the fact that the food had no flavor (seriously how does spicy salsa have no flavor?) or the fact that any time I used my check card there and didn't give them a tip (you know since they prepared my food), they would add a $1 or $2 in the tip line.....every....single....time. No bueno, sorry Salsarita's, you are officially Salsash***ty's in my book. Would it be inapporpriate for me to bring in a miniture sized crown and place it on an order of their mac n cheese? I hope not because I really think Mert's has the best mac n cheese in Charlotte! Creamy, cheesey, comforting, their mac n cheese has it all! I haven't been to Mert's in a couple of years but ventured in this past wk and it was just as good as I remembered it . \n\nSolid place for a down home lunch and the prices are pretty cheap. I used to get their pulled pork but this last time I saw the server bring out their BLT to another table and food envy hit immediately! Never would I order a BLT at a restaurant but when you put the BLT on a focaccia bread, I am all over that bad boy. Pair that up with the mac n cheese and I could only finish half of my sandwich and walked out with a tab less than $7. Next time I'll be saving room for their red velvet cake or banana cream pudding-totally worth clogging my arteries over!", "user_id": "cxTh9xxqbs-m8Paq6jAumg", "business_id": "gpCtDCSXIoQx70cq9itfNA"}
{"text": "sick...and not in the way my college roommate use to say \"that's sick! \" (meaning cool, awesome, sweet, wicked (variation of any of the previous). No this was just gross. \n\nAfter driving across town to two different malls to find a particular dress in my size, I worked up quite the appetite. Hey it's Friday- I'll go for some Americanized Asian...so I ordered the general Tso's with a maki roll ( not sushi- this is what they call their spring rolls), and noodles.\n\nMy noodles were cold...like really cold. The portion was beyond stingy- normally with these kind of take-out restaurants I cannot finish my meal, but their were exactly 11 pieces of chicken 7 of which were teeny-tiny bits... The texture of both meat and noodles was very mushy and overall not so tasty. When I paid with debit the girl at the counter literally handed my receipt and said \"sign-this\" ...so much for service. I will say it was cheap and the spring roll was edible. \n\nI should have known better than to give into mall food cravings...not worth the calories. But hey on a positive note I did find my dress size at CP Mall! My first impression was what a cute neighborhood! The historic and charming homes are such a treat in a city where everything seems brand new. \n\nUpon entering this pub-like restaurant/bar we were seated and greeted promptly. \n\nI ordered a cider on tap (a favorite of mine), a side salad, and the \"What it is\" . The star oddly enough was the salad, she said all their dressings were homemade and it certainly tasted that way.  The \"What it is\" was just ok in my opinion. I have had my share of amazing pasta dishes but never have been much of a rotini fan. The dish has a lot of dried herbs and I just prefer fresh...the chicken seemed almost too rubbed in cajun spice for my taste. That being said, I would like to give it another shot and order something else besides pasta ..I really am a tough critic in the Italian department. \n\nMy biggest gripe of the night was the pace of service. I don't know if the server (or chef) had somewhere to be but she was going a mile a minute. I wanted to relax and enjoy my meal not be rushed in and out in less than 45minutes. My dinner came as half of my salad remained uneaten...and the salad was literally brought out in less than a minute after I ordered it. I realize its a small venue with limited seating but there wasn't anyone waiting for a table and last  I checked this was not at a fast food joint. I didn't think this place was so bad either, we stopped in after a wedding for some drinks. The place wasn't too packed (they have a huge bar area) , but our bartender was lovely and the drinks tasted good. \n\nWe didn't eat but it seems to be typical bar-food. The atmosphere looks very corporate circa 90s ...if that makes any sense. I wouldn't run back anytime soon (not a very interesting/unique bar) but at the time it fit the bill just fine. I didn't grow up eating southern cooking but I love fried chicken, biscuits and gravy, and banana pudding just as well. So needless to say I had high hopes for Mert's. \n\nI went with the buttermilk and herb chicken fingers which sounded incredible. They were about $11 and came with two sides. Overall they felt flat and had an overwhelming garlic taste that became too much after one or two (and I love garlic -fyi)  I don't think I could eat them again. The Mac n Cheese as my side was a saving grace. Wow-awesome! Cheesy-stringy deliciousness and I ate it right up. My other side was the mashed potatoes which tasted great at first bite but again became overwhelming fast. Perhaps if I went with a veggie side I would have felt better but the food was so rich I felt queasy by the end. My boyfriend ate my cornbread as I don't care for that myself, and he liked it quite a bit. \n\nI had a bite of my boyfriends steak and eggs which were way overcooked and the steak was literally coated with grease - definitely not my type of thing. He said it was pretty average if a bit overcooked for him as well. \n\nI thought for the food quality it was a bit overpriced (but pretty standard for the area) and overall I just felt like everything was too salty, greasy, and rich for my own taste buds. Now I know you're probably saying well look what you ordered and perhaps that is true, but I have had fried chicken and mashed potatoes that felt decadent yet somehow less like my mouth was taking a grease bath.  If I went again I would order something MUCH lighter...lesson learned. \n\nOn a positive note the service was fast and friendly and the restaurant itself has a lot of memorabilia that makes for interesting conversation pieces. So for me Mert's is just ok.", "user_id": "NzWLMPvbEval0OVg_YDn4g", "business_id": "ji0VxQpFQvzzYMy9fY5fvw"}
