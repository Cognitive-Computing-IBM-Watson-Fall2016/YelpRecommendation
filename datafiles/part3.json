{"text": "I've had PF Changs both in Pgh and KC and honestly, I'm never been disappointed nor elated with the food. It's 'upscale' Ameri-Chinese food. You don't come here seeking 'authentic' Asian staples; it's all changed to some degree to suit American taste buds... nothing wrong with that, imo. Do I even know what 'authentic' Chinese food is? Yes, sortuv, somewhat. Will I stop putting quotes around 'everything'? Definitely not!\n\nIt was 45 min from closing time when we (party of 6) rushed in on a weeknight; got seated, ordered and ate without feeling rushed by the staff.\n\nThis particular PF Changs, on the Homestead Waterfront, had fast and friendly service, though he forgot our order of asparagus. We sampled everything from the the Szechuan shrimp to the Mongolian beef to the Dan Dan Noodles. Good flavors, nothing that stepped out in the crowd.\n\nI don't come here all that often but when I do, I invariably leave feeling satisfied and full. Beans, glorious, beans! So many many beans. Great Northern, Black, Kidney, Pinto, Pink (pink?), etc. etc. and so forth.\n\nOk ok, Reyna's is more than beans. Lots of different types of dried chillies, prepared salsas, chorizos, frozen tamales, different types of soda pop and drinks that you won't find in a regular grocers. \n\nI haven't tried the taco stand yet but the coup de grace of the grocers itself though is the fresh tortillas, both corn and flour. Delicious! (And beans). Finally made it to the taco stand on a crisp, sunny December day.\n\nYUM!! I had one solitary fish taco as I was running low on cash. But it was worth it. Put on some of their hottest hot sauce (which hit the spot), sat down at one of the tables and waded through the messiness. Consider me converted... I'll be back! Typical dive joint. The establishment is a little soggy but clean. The service is a little slow, especially during a weekday lunch hour, but friendly.\n\nThe cheese steak is good but not spectacular. The portion size is large enough. The fries alternate between crispy and soggy. Overall, it's not a bad place to go for lunch if you're looking for a basic hoagie. Came here for lunch.\n\nAtmosphere is traditional, lots of wood, white linens, etc. Old school feel to it. My server was very friendly and courteous without being over-attentive.\n\nThe wedding soup was good, looked like it was truly made from scratch. The garlic bread was delicious dunked in the soup. I ordered the napolitano (marinara with 4-cheeses) with thin spaghetti. It wasn't that busy on a Friday afternoon so it arrived pretty quickly.\n\nThe pasta was cooked al dente. The sauce wasn't spectacular but a good solid marinara and the cheese was well-distributed (don't you just hate one glob of cheese and the rest of the sauce is on its own). This is one of the better places to get a simple fried fish sandwich.\n\nThe atmosphere is a little wet, dank and dreary. The place feels as old as it looks. Still, the pictures of various celebrities and sports stars gives it an authentic, old-time feel.\n\nThe staff isn't overly friendly but they're not rude either; as another reviewer said, it's a little Pittsburghese attitude. It's just matter-of-fact. Come in, order your fish and eat it.\n\nDuring the summers, they also have soft-serve ice cream which is a nice treat after lunch.\n\nI keep coming back here because the fried fish sandwich really is worth it. A huge filet of fish, fried up simply. The fish is moist, perhaps a little greasy, but still delicious and the filet is thick so you're not getting more breading than fish.", "user_id": "3d0Vw3hPiUEWMwrlnC-IOQ", "business_id": "JDDeaNfb0JXD1NbznSIC9g"}
{"text": "For my group of friends, this is the ultimate post-5K run reward!\n\nHere are the rules (they are my rules, but you should adopt them for Dor-Stop success):\n1. Go only with 2-4 people (otherwise you are one of THOSE parties that will hold everything up and screw up the seating)\n2. Be prepared to wait.  If you do not wait, consider yourself the luckiest person alive.\n3. Order something savory (may I recommend the Breakfast Burrito or the Eggs Benedict?  Everything has a twist and a funny name, so you're going to spend some time actually reading the menu.  Get something special, don't just go with scrambled eggs and bacon - although I'm sure that's delicious too).\n4. Order specialty pancakes \"for the table\" (to share).  We haven't been able to get away from the drawing power of the pumpkin pancakes yet.  They are so thick, yet so fluffy at the same time!\n\nThe surprising news: they take credit cards (it gives off a \"cash only\" vibe).\n\nThe opportunity area: syrup that does not come in an old-fashioned squeeze bottle!  It takes me about 15 minutes to get the disgusting amount of syrup I want atop my fluffy pancakes. Four-stars for happy hour comfort.\n\nI write this review in the context of a Friday night spontaneous happy hour.  Why four stars?  Primarily the comphy seating.  Drink selection is on par with most other swanky downtown locations (decent beer list with some fun cocktails sprinkled here and there) and the staff is what I would expect - prompt and curteous but nothing out of this world.\n\nBut then there are the chairs, couches, leather benches, and multitude of mini tables to put your drink down (which I often need to do as I have a tendency to flap my hands around while telling stories).  Upstairs is where it's at.\n\nNote - you may want to give them a call first... the upstairs is booked for private parties sometimes and if you're stuck downstairs, it can get quite crowded. What can I say about The Smithfield Cafe....?  It is what it is.\n\nIs the decor nice? Of course not.\nAre the floors sticky? Of course they are.\nIs the waitstaff well versed in the latest culinary trends? Hell no.\nDo I love this little diner? OF COURSE!\n\nThey've basically got some great lunchtime staples (the Pittsburgh Salad, a really great burger, and some mediocre chili).  I have a soft spot in my heart for the tuna salad (open-faced on an English muffin topped with half a slice of a Kraft American cheese single).\n\nAbove all else, they have EXCELLENT bleu cheese dressing.  This is how you can weed good establishments from bad, in may cases.  This stuff is CHUNKY and CREAMY and downright deelish.\n\nAlso good for a cheap Friday happy hour (complete with Karaoke!).\n\nGive it a try.  It'll grow on you.... like fungus. Rhode-Islander approved!!\n\nHow have I not been to this place before?  Authentic clam chowder, delicious fried fish, tartar sauce by the bucket... heaven!\n\nI guess I can see where Pittsburghers may not share my sentiment, but believe me, this is the closest to New England-style seafood I have EVER encountered in the 'burgh.  OK, so they only have clam strips and not whole bellies and clam cakes (fritters) are nowhere to be seen, but the chowder and lightly breaded fish (Famous Fish sandwich) make up for it.\n\nI loved the dynamic in this place.  It was CROWDED (Friday during Lent, what should I have expected?), but the kitchen staff was turning out fish sandwiches by the dozen.\n\nThis will definitely become a regular lunch spot for me (if, that is, I can find enough people in the 'burgh who actually like seafood).", "user_id": "uT1Ls6QFjNX2mL3JjYQGpA", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw"}
{"text": "I am a fan of this place.  I love the dogs, of course.  I love the beers, of course.  I love the Beer Cave the most.  I'm not sure if it's the largest collection of bottles, but it's pretty impressive nonetheless.  I just wish that the beers I wanted had the prices labeled.  I swear, every one I grabbed for had price tags on the beers surrounding it but not on the one I wanted.\n\nAnyway, the dogs are tender and juicy.  Even the veggie dogs are pretty convincingly \"dog-like.\"  The fries are plentiful and pretty damn good.  Greasy and salty (but not too much of either) and a perfect accompaniment to beers and hot dogs.  The servers are friendly and helpful with the menu.\n\nPros: great beer selection, wonderful food, friendly staff\nCons: I was here after brunch to catch the hockey game and they had NCAA basketball on instead; not a big deal, but enough to be annoying My family and I came here for Sunday brunch to celebrate my father's birthday.  We were seated around noon and I was starving.  As other people have said, don't you dare eat a single thing before you come here or you will have to be rolled out like Violet Beauregarde.\n\nThey start you off with a complimentary blood mary or mimosa.  Um, hai.  I like your style.  And you pick your entree (of course, the famous pasta trio is an option).\n\nThen you get to take your fill of their antipasto spread.  A dozen different salad options, mussels, cheese, olives, frittata...  I had to try a bit of everything and yes, I was that person walking back to my table with two plates.\n\nMy entree was duck gnocchi.  I felt a little guilty because I adore duckies but damn was it tasty.  The gnocchi were like little pillows they were so light and fluffy.  Lidia, WHAT IS YOUR SECRET!?  Best gnocchi I have ever had (and I don't even really like it that much; something about it just called to me).\n\nAnd then they wrap you up with a dessert table.  I was about read to pop and we had homemade ice cream and cake at home but I couldn't stop myself.  The little cookies were crisp and perfectly satisfying to wrap up a meal.  But I didn't stop there.  You're at Lidia's, you eat the tiramisu.  Creamy, sweet but not too sweet, and perfect with a cup of coffee.  That coffee was so good, I didn't even need cream and sugar.\n\nSlight downfalls: the waiter didn't know who was the birthday person (discreetly ask if you don't know, just don't plunk it down in front of someone) and the wait staff cleared away all serviceware before I was done.  I still had bread on my plate and I also needed a knife to cut through the baguette French-toast-like dessert - would have liked to enjoy it but I couldn't.\n\nAll in all, a great brunch.  Definitely the place to go for a special occasion. Seedy and awesome.  This place has been around for years and you can tell it, from the black-and-white pictures hung on the mirrored wall behind the bar to the fading tiles on the floor.\n\nI had a crab cake sandwich and it was perfection.  Large chunks of crab on a potato bun with a swish of mayo, lettuce, and tomato slice.  The house-made chips are great, though I didn't get a whole lot of them with my sandwich - probably less than a serving, though I'm okay because the sandwich was so good, you just needed a little crunch to go with it.\n\nMy boyfriend got the jumbo fish sandwich (not to be confused with the massive fish sandwich) and it was indeed jumbo.  Huge piece of fresh cod on a kaisesr roll.  It was the kind where the ends are hanging off the bun.  I can only imagine the size of the massive sandwich!  The fish inside was tender and the batter was perfectly crunchy and golden.\n\nFresh, delicious fish cooked perfectly.  Our server was super nice and took great care of us.

{"text": "We stopped in here for a very late night dinner after our flight into Pittsburgh from Charlotte. We were staying just up the street at the Pittsburgh Renaissance Hotel. It was after 10:00 pm and you could not get a bite to eat in the hotel.\n\nSo we walked down the street - most places were already closed, and a couple of places that were open that had bars - were no longer serving food.\n\nFortunately we found Salonika Gyros! We both ordered a traditional Gyro, and they were prepared fresh and hot on the spot.\n\nWe knew we must have a good place - as 3 of Pittsburgh's finest from their police department were taking a dinner break and eating in here as well.\n\nThe Gyro was damn tasty! The meat was succulent and perfectly cooked with a slight char to it, and the yogurt sauce was just the right compliment to the Gyro!\n\nSalonika is not much to look at - it's your local working man's food joint in a traditional northern blue collar city! Which means it's great ambiance! Appreciate it for what it is!\n\nI'd definitely come back here for more Gyros and to try other stuff! Had dinner here one evening. Ordered the Greek salad with Feta cheese - AND a Gyro platter. plus a glass of lemonade.\n\nSalad was very basic - iceberg lettuce with a smattering of other greens and onions, some feta cheese, dressing - and one olive. Just one.\n\nThen the platter came out - two pieces of Pita bread, several long thin pieces of Gyro meat, hummus, rice - and another Greek salad. Now why the hell didn't the guy who took my order bother to tell me I got a salad with my Gyro platter?\n\nI ate the Pita and Gyro meat along with the hummus and most of the rice. Interestingly enough - this second Greek salad had - drum roll please.....\n\nOne olive! Must be an olive shortage in Pittsburgh. I did not eat the second salad as I was all salad-ed out at that point. I did eat the second olive though.\n\nFood IMHO was just average - it felt more authentic than some of these places that serve you the Gyro meat wrapped up in a piece of Pita with a yogurt sauce.\n\nI got one refill on my lemonade. The older gentleman who took my order was not particularly outgoing or friendly. In fact he was kind of gruff and standoffish - I was very friendly and polite during my visit. Had dinner at Lemon Grass earlier this week. When I walked in the place was empty. Got to pick where I wanted to sit. First thing I noticed is the place was an absolute sauna. I asked my server about why it was so hot in the restaurant? She shrugged and did not seem interested.\n\nI ordered the Lemon Grass soup with shrimp and the Papaya salad. I used the terms \"Tom Yum\" and \"Som Tum\" when I ordered. These terms are not used in their menu - I was under the impression they were fairly standard terms for these Thai menu items. In any case - she had no clue to what I was referring to - so I used their terms.\n\nSoup came out immediately - soup was not very spicy or lemon grassy - which is ironic given the name of this place. There was a lot more tomato chunks in their version of this soup than I've experienced before. I would not order this again.\n\nThen the Papaya salad came out - just ok - not spicy and bright like a good Papaya salad should be.\n\nWater glass was refilled promptly the one time it was starting to look empty.\n\nWon't come back here again unless they do something about the lack of AC and better food!", "user_id": "EY2M507w8246POHv37TLyA", "business_id": "WXpi9z1bqF9raZSW8z70Ow"}
{"text": "Microbrewed beers are only a plus to me when they're better than the beer I would have drank otherwise.  One waitress I had while there tried to split the uprights between macrobrew and trendy by describing one of their beers as \"kind of like Coors Light\".  If I wanted Coors, I'll pay half as much and have one.  \n\nThe food is actually a saving grace, as it was pretty good.  Head next door to Sing Sing for drinks, though. Much like every other Eat 'n Park (3 or 4 stars worth of chain-diner food), except the last five times I've been here, the service has been damn, damn, daaaaaaaamn slow.  It's always fun to see the staff smoking out back while I've waited an hour for some scrambled eggs. Best independent coffeeshop I've ever had the pleasure to visit.\n\nBest americano I've ever had.  Some of the best espresso I've ever had.  Great desserts, pastries, and cookies.  Good food.  The employees are awesome.\n\nThe owner apparently put the shop there because their neighborhood didn't previously have anything like it.  The shop is also all about bicycling as transportation, sponsoring regular group rides around town, and also group walks for those not bicycle-inclined. You can see their second bar through the front windows.  I always assumed that that was their first bar, and just walked by the place maybe a hundred times, until walking in and noticing that everyone was drinking in a different bar.\n\nIn other words, this place is *huge* inside.  The place looks like it was decorated about the same time many other cities built up chinatown areas; I like the decor, even if it might be slightly dated.  \n\nChinese and Korean food, at or above my expectations.  The stuff on the menu is good, and they're willing to put together things that aren't on the menu if you ask nicely.  Kung pao tofu is my favorite so far. This place has steadily improved over the years, and never fails to make me happy.  \n\nIt's stocked with every variety of weird hippie food.  It's also stocked with the best produce anywhere in the city in the winter months when Giant Eagle's selection looks beat up.  The prepared foods case in the back is deliciously weird.  And it's locally owned/operated, so you're not exactly sending your hard earned money to Whole Food's CEO.\n\nThe membership is lifetime, apparently, which the employees always kind of failed to express; I thought you had to pay for it yearly, and the difference is pretty big.   That said, I live far enough away that getting here regularly still doesn't justify the membership. Well, it has good hot dogs and a wide, wide variety of beer, stocking without pretense; Miller and Unibrau.  The hot dogs are good.  The beer is unfortunately not so cheap; six packs aren't much cheaper than just buying four or five beers.  Bad for groups more that four people; great for two or three. Average pizza. But with ten guys working - and not much business at the moment - it still took twenty minutes to get a slice of pepperoni. I'll walk across the street next time. This is the best Irish pub in the city; while Claddagh is a corporate chain (that isn't quite authentic), and Piper's Pub is a wonderful pub... of the British Isles, Mullaney's is Irish, and a great place to grab some food and drink.\n\nTons of travelling entertainers and bands, fantastic eats, and friendly, good staff. Just had the panang tofu for lunch, and was crazy underwhelmed.  Tiny portion, very watery sauce, and just no *zing* at all to the flavor.

{"text": "Apparently it's socially unacceptable to continue going to Chuck E. Cheese after you've reached puberty. This I learned the hard way. Fortunately, the geniuses behind Dave & Busters got my back. Sometimes I just need to escape the stress of adulthood with a few rounds of skee-ball (don't judge me). I can work with the amount and variety of games, but it could definitely be better. I would suggest coming in on Wednesdays for half-price games to get more bang for your buck!\n\nBe aware of the obnoxious guests. I expect children to be a bit rowdy, but even some adults suddenly forget all socially acceptable behavior once you throw them in the arcade. \n\nI come to D&B for the games and not the food. Aside from the horrible customer service I've experienced, their food also tastes generic and mediocre.  For the prices they're charging, it is not worth it. Save a few bucks and find a better meal elsewhere. My standards are fairly low for small Chinese take-out restaurants, and Tasty meets that standard. My go-to order is always the General Tso's Tofu which I have had several times. The tofu is usually mushy and the sauce is a bit too sweet, but it's all tolerable. I would say they're on par with the quality of other average Chinese restaurants, but the prices are on the higher end. The lunch deals are a great value though if you're someone looking for a low cost alternative. \n\nI have never had great interactions with the employees/owners. They're not the most welcoming and their English is very broken so there's always some sort of miscommunication. This is not my top choice for Chinese take-out for sure, but I guess there are worse options out there. Primanti's is a Pittsburgh classic, and I've always felt some sort of obligation to love this place. Although I can certainly appreciate the uniqueness of a Primanti's sandwich, I just don't understand all the hype. So there I was again, hoping this was the time I finally become a Primanti's fanatic.\n\nThe restaurant was very busy when we came in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. There was a bit of a wait, but the employees were efficient when it came to getting us seated as quickly as possible. Our waitress, however, seemed too preoccupied with other customers, so we spent a lot of time waiting to get her attention. Frustrating, but it is what it is. \n\nThey offer two vegetarian sandwich options: the Deluxe Double Egg & Cheese and the Southwest Black Bean Burger. Both are good, and I've always preferred the black bean burger, but I decided to give the egg & cheese another shot. It was an average quality sandwich. Nothing mind-blowing. Though I usually love how they pile on the fries, these fries were so undercooked to the point where the insides were RAW. Once again, Primanti's, you have failed to impress me.\n\nPurely because it's Primanti's, I will probably be back. If it was any other sandwich shop, no thanks. Here we go again. When it comes to office lunches, there's never any question. We're heading to San Remo. \n\nIt's hard for me to hate on pizza in general because, well, it's pizza! San Remo's pizza quality is pretty standard, in my opinion.The crust (my favorite part) is always full and crispy - just how I like it. Then you got the super gooey cheese, your choice of toppings, and loaded with a free layer of grease. Mmmm, heartburn never tasted so delicious. \n\nIn preparation for the dreaded bikini season, I opted for a salad (a.k.a. random pizza toppings on lettuce) this time around. Just awful. The only vegetarian salad option was the tossed salad, so I didn't have much to choose from. The vegetables were cut so large that it was a nuisance to eat, and it's actually very overpriced for the horrible quality salad you get. Sorry San Remo - salads don't seem to be your thing. \n\nSERVICE IS HORRENDOUS!!! It really is pure torture sometimes. We come in a big group usually (10-20 people), but a reservation is made. We show up, and the tables are not set up. Ugh. But no biggie - we agree to split into different tables. Our group usually orders 6-8 pizzas, and it always takes a full hour to get our food. Ridiculous, especially if they were expecting us to be there. We get the same waitress every time and she never fails to be completely RUDE to everyone in our group. Come on lady, can you honestly be cranky everyday of your life? I understand it can be a bit hectic serving a big group, but the 'tude ain't helping anyone. \n\nTo conclude, average pizza paired with AWFUL service.

{"text": "This can be summed up as follows: For Greek food, go to Salonika directly across the street. \nThis place is below par in just about every way. The prices are not high, but the servers seem more like salesmen in pressuring you to add dessert, etc. (At lunch?). I haven't been impressed by the food after numerous tries, and the atmosphere is dated and dingy. \nI would much rather go across the street at a place with no pretensions (counter service) and pay for honest food that I can see being prepared. Sushi Kim has long held a reputation as one of the best sushi restaurants in town. However, after repeated visits, I wonder if this stems from the day when Sushi Kim was practically the only sushi restaurant in town. \n\nPlease note that this review pertains to the sushi dining only, for dinner. I've not been there for lunch or had the Korean food.\n\nMy most recent visit typifies each time I've had there. Upon arrival, the place is nearly empty. The service is attentive but indifferent, as if they realize you're a dirty dish that needs to be cleaned - you're taken care of like any other chore.\n\nThe miso soup arrived, and was very tasty. However, it was also past lukewarm to the point of being cool. This is pretty normal, as well. \n\nThe most disappointing part is the sushi itself. It is not inexpensive (really, sushi is rarely inexpensive), but upon arrival, it is a bit too warm, and just doesn't taste fresh. Being that much of this dish consists of raw fish, freshness concerns me a bit more than, say, french fries at a bar. Each and every variety is equally disappointing, with the end result being \"Meh\" to \"Yech.\" \n\nWith such a large population of sushi places in Pittsburgh these days, and even Giant Eagle in a pinch, there is not really a reason to frequent this place anymore. After a handful of visits based on reputation and the hope that this time might be better, I've made my last trip to Sushi Kim. This is my go-to place for dates, in-town visitors, nice occasions. Been a customer for years and have no plans to change that. While it has several notable flaws, the all-around strengths of this establishment make it a top any-occasion choice in Pittsburgh. \n\nSituated in what looks like a small white house than you'd never see unless looking for, this is a quirky, unique interior. There is a piano at the bar, and a mannequin sitting there you'd swear was real until you looked with a startled grin. \n\nOne of two managers always greet you and check in at least once at your table. They are friendly, solicitous, and helpful. \n\nThe service can be under-experienced at times, but always, ALWAYS pleasant and helpful. They bring out a card at the beginning of each meal and read of a seemingly endless list of specials not on the menu. These are amazing - they vary from the simple (pierogies fried in butter and onions) to the weird (duck mousse and pita). As if these aren't options aren't enough, your large menu, including seafood, steak, meats, and pastas, has each option prepared in your choice of three different ways. This makes it perfect for the picky and the adventurous both. \n\nA winning touch is the staff that circulates with free drink samples and hors-douvres. I've been to many a restaurant and yet to find any at this level that offer this touch of service that makes you glad you're there. \n\nThe price for all this is quite fair! After taking my mother there and having a drink, appetizers, salads, dinner, and dessert, the check was under $70 with tip. I don't think these prices can be beat. \n\nThe cons are only two: (1) Not every dish is executed well. They strive to be new, adventurous and different, and don't always succeed; (2) I'm a huge fan of desserts and, though there's always quite the variance, I've yet to have one that I enjoyed. The coconut ice cream was in particular a failure: vanilla ice cream with tasteless, dry coconut flakes on it is pretty inexcusable. \n\nAll in all, I couldn't really recommend a place more highly for any occasion more fancy than McDonald's and less fancy than Ruth's Chris.", "user_id": "SqJ3xHEcHpH1ylOQvkfXcA", "business_id": "PxP19Rb88OQKiSMl2oWNsg"}

The food has always been good (not spectacular, but good) and the prices have always been more than reasonable.  \n\nTo be honest, the food doesn't look like much when it's served; sometimes my moussaka looks too watery and there was one time my friend's dinner just looked like a mess.  However, the food always tastes good and is very well-seasoned even if it doesn't look like a masterpiece.  I have found that the food can vary from time to time; it's never bad, but sometimes I think that it is more tasty than at others.\n\nAs far as the service is concerned, I have been here when I've been one of 3 couples in the whole restaurant as well as when the entire place has been swamped with patrons and the service varies accordingly.  Sometimes my servers have been almost too attentive.  The last time, however, they seemed to be short-staffed and my date and I were forgotten in the mix for about 20 minutes.  It really depends upon how many folks are there at a given time, but the servers have always been unfailingly polite.  \n\nIt has a very interesting decor inside (lots of Greek paraphernalia) and features pictures of Christo's family; it really reminds you that this is a family business.  I've also sat outside which was really nice on a summer night even if there weren't breathtaking views. \n\nI wouldn't bother with the gyros here since they don't seem to be their forte.  Stick with the other traditional Greek recipes and you should be pleased especially when you consider the prices. \n\nThe Greek coffee is good (and served with great presentation), but it is very small (think an espresso shot) and rather expensive for the volume served; I think I'll go for regular coffee the next time.  Also, Christo's has house wines that are worth trying; I am a fan of the white one.\n\nThe Jackie O cake is the dessert that everyone orders and with good reason; it is a unique sort of cake.  It is chilled and very, very moist with a sort of whipped topping which makes it a very light dessert.  I find that most desserts are too heavy or sweet and so this cake is one of my favorite desserts.  And at $3/slice, it is a steal compared to the desserts offered at other restaurants downtown.  Apparently, they sometimes have a chocolate version of the Jackie O; they had it on New Years Eve but I didn't try it then and wish I had. Cafe Sam is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the area.  As others have said, it is somewhat quirky (the mannequin they have seated at the bar is a bit unnerving the first time you notice it), but the food is consistently good, the portions are nicely sized, and the prices are excellent especially if you order the right stuff.  The interior is decorated with lots of antiques and stained glass and the upstairs patio is really a fantastic retreat from the Oakland/Bloomfield area if you go on a night when the weather is good.  They always have a ton of daily specials as well as drink specials (the $4 cosmo is certainly worth every penny of my grad student salary!).  Every time I visit, there's always been a point in the meal when one of the servers brings around a sampler tray with an appetizer or a drink; they've offered samples of things varying from strawberry or peach daquiris, a pizza appetizer, cold berry soup, etc.  \n\nI HIGHLY recommend the baked almond-crusted brie appetizer; the cheese is delicious with the almonds and raspberry sauce and they arrange tons of fresh fruit on the plate for you to munch at as well.

I have been to Casbah so many times over the years that the visits all meld together, but on this particularly occasion I had the arugula salad to begin with which was delicious and my friend had the butternut squash soup which she really enjoyed.  We both ordered the the Scottish Salmon which was so delicious and tender that it literally melted in my mouth.  The house-made pastas are always a great option if as is the duck or the lamb which I've had both on a few occasions.  Their wine list is always spectacular - on this visit I had a glass of the Riesling from Urban, Germany and my friend had a glass of Pinot Grigio from Lenotti, Italy.  We had no room for dessert on this visit, but any of their desserts that have the Meyer lemons is always a hit and I am a die-hard chocolate fan and I will forgo chocolate for one of their delicious meyer lemon dessert creations.  I haven't been to Casbah for brunch in quite some time, but after having gone to Eleven recently for brunch, I'm keen to try Casbah for brunch again soon. I remember going here when I was a little kid to celebrate my grandparents' 50th wedding anniversary.  I thought this place was \"fancy\" of so many years ago and I remember going out back to play in the nearby park and I also thought that was really cool.  When I moved to Pittsburgh, I moved to Brighton Heights where Miller's is located but I only went once a few years ago and it was just ok.  I decided to give it another shot the other night and I really regret it.  I ordered the fried fish sandwich and even though it was crisp on the outside to the point of being somewhat burnt yet the inside was cold and the fish just had a weird texture like maybe it was freezer burnt or really old.  The place is dingy and poorly lite, it looks dirty and the overall experience was just downright unpleasant.  No, just no.  That is all. This was my second time at Cafe Sam and both times I dined here because it was arranged through my job.  The first time I dined here, I was looking forward to it, because everyone whom I've ever heard talk about this place raved about it, yet I left wondering if everyone who has raved about it just has really bad taste in restaurants and their definition of \"good\" food.\n\nSo, on my second visit I inwardly cringed as my 2 companions raved about the place and teased the waitress about the list of specials which is absolutely ridiculous however it does seem as though the restaurant has pared down their enormous menu and specials menu from the only other time that I was there (I remember it taking our waitress at least 5 minutes to ramble off the specials on the previous visit while on this particular visit it seemed to take half the time.  \n\nI ordered the linguine with shrimp scampi which I asked to add spinach but was told that it already had spinach (the menu is so large that it would be impossible for them to list the ingredients in each dish) - so while someone may think, \"oh, it's great that they have a large menu,\" the truth of the matter is that they don't seem to be able to therefore do anything well - it's all rather extremely mediocre at best to nearly inedible.  My companions enjoyed their meals however, and they ordered the linguine with salmon and the smoked hot dog special covered in some sort of  BBQ type of sauce.  My pasta was bland - I never add salt when I go out to eat and I had to add salt but even adding salt and some pepper really did nothing to give the dish flavor.  I left the restaurant dissatisfied and hungry for a good plate of pasta, which I rarely eat by the way, and it actually had me thinking about how much better the Olive Garden's pasta is compared to Cafe Sam.  I'm just completely baffled about the popularity of this restaurant though as some others who have given the restaurant the fair 1-3 star reviews have already mentioned, this is a haven for senior citizens and from the other Yelp reviews for out of town guests who maybe don't know what good food really is.  With all of the other options available nearby in Shadyside and in Bloomfield this is the last place that I would go next to the other Baum Blvd. debacle, Ritter's Diner.  I don't know why or how folks flock to either restaurant nor how they rave about either establishment other than to say that both places must hold some nostalgic value that makes people overlook the bad food.", "user_id": "Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}
{"text": "I wavered between 4 and 5 stars here. If the rating was strictly based on food, I'd go with 5, easily. But, it's based on service, too, which is why I had to knock one off. Here's the deal...\n\nI love Morton's. Its old-school interior and no-gimmicks shtick is awesome. Plus, of course, the food is fantastic. However, I wanted to branch out, and Ruth's Chris had some great reviews, so I utilized Yelp's oh-so-convenient Open Table reservation feature, and scored a table for two on a Saturday night. \n\nOur reservation was for 8:30. We arrived right on the dot, but were told to go to the bar and wait. So, my boyfriend and I both got cocktails -- he had Glenlivet, which is obvs hard to mess up, and I got the Peachy Pear-tini, which was delish. And then, we waited. And waited. Around 9, our table was ready. \n\nOur waitress was Kristen, and she was fantastic. Very attentive, friendly, witty, and knowledgeable about the food. Here's our food rundown:\n\n- Barbequed shrimp app: I initially thought was BBQ sauce + shrimp, but it ain't. It's succulent li'l shrimp in a deliciously garlicky, white wine-infused sauce with a cayenne kick. Kristen suggested that we dip the bread in the sauce after the shrimp were gone, and we happily took her up on that. \n\n-Ruth's chopped salad: Holy crap. The most memorable salad of my life. I rarely rave about salads. In fact, I think this is the first time I ever have in my life. But, this salad was incredible! It has crispy onion strings on top, hearts of palm (which I love), and this amazing lemon-basil dressing, among other delicious things. So awesome.\n\n- Filet mignon: My boyfriend and I both opted for the filet. I got mine with extra butter, he got his with a bleu cheese crust. Mine was phenomenal. The sizzling butter really adds an extra dimension of flavor that puts it beyond Morton's. My boyfriend found the bleu cheese to be a li'l too generous, and he wound up scraping some off, but still enjoyed it.\n\n- Broccoli au gratin: Again, phenomenal. I've never enjoyed broccoli so much. Granted, it was swimming in bubbling, gooey cheese...\n\n- Potatoes lyonnaise: We took a risk here, as many people rave about the garlic mashed potatoes, and we saw mountains of them carried past our table. But, it paid off big-time. These were, hands-down, the BEST lyonnaise potatoes EVER. Pamela's has nothing on these. Every mouthful was a medley of crusty brown potatoes and caramelized onion goodness. I dream about these potatoes.\n\nSo, based on that experience, we went back again the next Saturday. Different waitress, same food (literally, we ordered exactly the same items, 'cause they were so damn good). I don't remember the waitress' name that we had the second time, but we waited longer for food to appear, were checked on far less, she took the cocktail shaker with my extra martini in it before I'd gotten to pour it in my glass, our steaks were not done correctly (he got my medium-rare, I got his medium-well), and it took forever to get the check. I really think it ruins the experience when you're done eating and ready to go, and you're just sitting there, drumming your fingers, looking around the dining room and wondering, \"Where the hell is the waitress with our check?\" \n\nThat said, we will definitely be back. We'll just request to be seated in Kristen's section! :) I'm having an affair. A pizza affair. I have forsaken my darling Adrian's for Angelo's... And it's all because of a white pizza. \n\nOkay, for realz now: Angelo's white pizza is ridiculously delicious. It comes with tomatoes. I added pepperoni, 'cause I was feeling kinda wild. When the pizza arrived and I opened the lid, I had to gasp. The cheese! Ohh, the glorious cheese!\n\nThere were regal mountains of ricotta... Majestic valleys of melted mozzarella... Fragrant Italian herbs infiltrated my nostrils... Why am I using the word \"nostrils\" in a restaurant review? Gross. \n\nAnyway, it took all my willpower not to have a pizza eating contest with myself right then and there. You just have to try this pizza. The crust, the tomato, and the pepperoni are all awesome, too, but trust me -- if you like cheese (and who doesn't), you'll love this.\n\nOn top of that, their fries are fresh and served in lah-arge portions, and their steak, cheese, and mushroom sandwich is phenomenal. I get it sans the tomato and lettuce -- but keep the onions and mayo. The bread is all nice and toasty, and I swear there's some secret ingredient in there that is a magical a flavor booster, 'cause it's just SO delish!", "user_id": "zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA", "business_id": "0FgwBx7pgmNdUtsd_T8UYQ"}
{"text": "This is my favorite place to order delivery pizza from. they are fast and consistent in quality and the pizza is always great. I've had their cheese steak subs too which were pretty good as well...but the pizza rocks. :) terrible... terrible terrible terrible... funny, the food there reminded me of the end of Goodfellas where the guy ordered pasta in a restaurant and got watery noodles and ketchup... yeah, not too far off the mark here. \n\nlet me back up a bit first.... My stepson and I were on our own for dinner so made sense to go out for the evening. So I picked this place knowing it was a kid friendly joint and not chili's or fuddruckers etc. The building itself is great. I loved the feeling of going into this renovated looking warehouse. He thought it was cool as well. The best part was inside. the decor is fantastic, and really the only reason to go. Loads of vintage signs and things and smack in the middle of the one dining room - a real vintage trolly car - completely renovated... of course I asked for us to be seated inside there... that was really neat. \n\nThen the food came... I had spaghetti and Meatballs and a Caesar salad. Now, the salad was really flavorful and fresh. Normally I hate salads in places like this. the lettuce tastes old and rubbery... not in this case. it was excellent. The spaghetti on the other hand - wow, watery, slightly overcooked noodles and sauce I bet was straight out of a Hunt's Spaghetti sauce can. the meatballs were frozen and reheated - i hate that off taste frozen meat takes on. so the salad got an A and spaghetti was a bit loser. \n\nMy stepson ordered the Italian wedding soup - he loved it - I did not try it... he also got the same watery noodles with the mushroom red sauce. Those mushrooms must have come straight from a can. they were button and the one I tasted had that tinned flavor.... so essentially this restaurant depends completely on frozen, processed, canned ingredients rather than fresh and flavorful. \n\nBottom line... have kids with you? they will love it... just the adults? find something... anything else... it is going to disappoint. I am not really certain how this place is getting the stellar reviews that it has. we just had a quick bite there last night and it was easily one of the worst meals that I have ever had the pleasure of paying for. While the people running the shop were lovely, it was not worth the $17 or so we paid.\n\nI had small cheese steak sub - asking only for mayo and lettuce. you would think that might be a nice time to let me know that they use some sort of house garlic-herb mayo instead of actual mayo. but no. So after a good bit of waiting my sub comes out with this weird speckly dressing on top of the lettuce... yes, this is that mayo - which is disgusting. I thought it was ranch and that is when he lady, with a smile, explained it was their house mayo... no, they don't use regular mayo here. \n\nso, let me tell you about this mayo:\n\n1. it is heavily flavored with garlic powder - which tastes seriously like chemicals on a good day and just should not be considered food in any way shape or form. Mixed in with this were some dried herbs - maybe an italian mix? who knows. all I could taste was the overwhelming chemical, fake garlic flavor. Hey, I love garlic and cook with it daily - mind you I actually use the real stuff. \n\n2. it is really thin... I mean thin like salad dressing, runny, thin. Um, isn't mayo supposed to be thick and spreadable? even the stuff you see at subway is thicker. this stuff tasted like really cheap, bad, ranch dressing.\n\nSo, after giving it a good effort to try to eat this \"sub\" - I gave up and picked off the bread on the top of the sub - the bread was pretty stellar though. still hungry I decided to try to scrap off the mayo/lettuce disaster and go for the meat and cheese. um... salt? the meat, which suspiciously looked like those thin sheets of steak-um had zero flavor. one bite and I rejected it. While we are talking about the meat - why use this garbage? I am paying almost 6 bucks for this sub. I want to see yummy chopped up steak bits like you see at even a mall sub shop. not this grey, disgusting 1980s looking flavorless \"meat\".  At least the bottom of the sub roll was salvageable... I ate the bread. \n\nOn to the pizza. My husband had two slices of pepperoni and my daughter had a slice of plain cheese. \n\nOk, pizza. well, this too was a massive disappointment. since I was still hungry after dumping the majority of my sub I tried both of their pizza slices. it reminded me of a nice store-bought frozen pizza. yes, bland. bad sauce with flavorless cheese. \n\nMy husband is a freak for pepperoni pizza and of the two slices he almost finished one of them. yes, more for the garbage. My daughter? she is three.. she isn't really a foodie (yet) but she got thru some of her cheese pizza... she actually spit some of it out but to be fair - she is three. I tried her pizza and honestly, all I could manage to somewhat enjoy was the crust which was nothing to rave about but it was tolerable. \n\nTo provide a baseline - we typically order from Rialto's and while they are not terrible they decent enough for a sub shop - pizza place.  this place... ugh. never. again. ever. We ended up throwing out about 80% of what we paid for. This place insults their customers with sub-par, dated, poor quality food.", "user_id": "1f-m_nZYyNZCvVQDuW6rnA", "business_id": "lHP5STO7aomlEQixH8m1aA"}
{"text": "Casbah is the type of restaurant that I find most difficult to write about.\n\nI came here recently with my beau for a special birthday dinner, seeing as they had several vegetarian options on their menu. We booked our reservation on OpenTable, which I was glad to see that they actually used. I noted that both of us diners were vegetarian and found that our server and hostess were very accommodating in that respect.\n\nWe were seated outside, which offered us a pleasant experience on their lovely patio. Their ambiance is nice and their service outstanding. I found that everyone there knew what they were talking about and possessed a deep passion for food, as opposed to obnoxious pretense which upscale restaurants like Casbah can have.\n\nAs for the food, it was above average. Nothing outstanding, but definitely still tasty. My boyfriend ordered the gnocchi (made veg), which turned out to be excellent, while I got the cavatelli (also made veg). We also shared a half-order of the torchetti and unfortunately, neither the cavatelli nor the torchetti stood out too much. The gnocchi and the appetizer (grilled chickpea flatbread) were by far the highlights.\n\nIn the end, come here for the service and ambiance, but don't expect to have the meal of your lifetime. Quiet Storm truly is a wonderful neighborhood gem. Surrounded by a desolate urban landscape, I never would've expected this colorful, creative coffee shop to have such impressive food.\n\nMy dinner here consisted of an apple panini and a \"shampoo\", a strange (but delicious!) cherry and almond cream soda. It very well might have taken me 20 minutes or more simply to decide on my beverage of choice - their list was not only long, but offered more innovative choices than I could have ever dreamt up. Among them, an impressive array of Italian sodas (lavender & lemon, mango & lime, white choc & mint, etc.), an enticing selection of lemonades (ginger lemonade, lavender lemonade), and some excellent-sounding tea combinations. To top it off, almost all flavors were available in the form of vegan milkshakes. How they concocted all of these culinary ideas is absolutely beyond me. (I apologize to the coffee drinkers. As a tea drinker myself, I hardly paid attention to that half of the menu.)\n\nThe apple panini I ordered came out quickly and was complemented with a side of tortilla chips and salsa. My panini included granny smith apples, apple butter, sharp cheddar, cream cheese, and seisage (vegetarian sausage) atop sun-dried tomato bread (though it seemed more like raisin to me). Never in a million years would I have come up with this strange combination of flavors, but it definitely worked. As described in the menu, indeed it was \"highly addictive\".\n\nTable service was great, nothing took too long and it seemed pleasant and casual. No overbearing waiters, no frills, etc.\n\nGiven the fact that I live about a mile away, I think they should be expecting yet another regular in the very near future. Six words can succinctly sum this place up: Good neighborhood pizza on the cheap!\n\nThe interior is a bit rough-looking and the service is sort of endearingly yinzer. Nothing wrong with that, considering it IS a neighborhood dive. Their pizza is definitely a notch above the rest and their prices are very reasonable. Unfortunately, they don't do too many specials and their menu is pretty run-of-the-mill. It's definitely a traditional New York-style pizza kind of place (in other words, no crazy/awesome combinations or vegan options - sorry).\n\nIn the end, you really can't go wrong with Pizza Italia.

{"text": "I've read countless 5-star reviews of this coffee shop and I'm sorry, but I don't wholly agree with, well, everyone else; so, here's my slightly alternative take on the cafe.  I'm aware, like many reviewers on this site, that not every place is aiming for me as the target customer; but even still, there's no way this is a five star coffee shop. Yes, the coffee is good and if I happen to be lost in highland park someday on foot, I'm sure I'd stop in to get it again.  But the place itself was a turn off, despite the interesting people that it attracts.  Glossy refinished exposed wood beams, fake grape vines over the windows, and odd light fixtures create a tacky atmosphere I can't overlook or sit in.  I think this is a great coffee shop if you happen to own a house in highland park, but for me it's going to be voluto or espresso a mano from now on - it's just not worth the drive. A nice, cheap place to get your vegetarian/vegan eat on.  Brunch is always nice and the specialty coffee drinks are fun to look through, if only for the names, meanwhile, you'll be eating off melamine and drinking from odd glasses; but, the food is great for the price and someone has to employ all the hipsters on penn ave. I just found this place a month back and I'm kind of blown away by how awesome it is. Fresh produce, awesome prepared salads and dips, bulk everything, natural cleaners, and plenty of hippie garbage you can't help but fill your shelves with. The best part is that they try to stock up with locally sourced produce, milk, and meat. And you can get a good discount if you purchase stock in the co-op. I'm not from PA, I'm from VA.  In VA I worked at a wine and beer bar, where we served and I tasted some of the best beers in the world.  And in VA we don't have absurd old beer and wine control laws, meaning our access to reasonably priced, intelligently stocked beer is much higher than pittsburgh.  That said, the best selection of beer I've found in this city has been at D's.  You will find a number of american craft brews, trappist ales, etc.  The only problem is the price...  which is solvable.  D's has a great system, if you buy a bottle of beer to take out of the restaurant they take 1 dollar off the bottle.  This dollar off doesn't matter when you consider how small a normal bottle is, but when you look at the larger bottles it does.  The prices for their larger bottles with the dollar off are not much higher than you would pay in a specialty beer shop in a less regulated state.  The only problem is that you have to commit to drinking three or four beers instead of one - I'm not really seeing the issue with that, but I'm sure someone will.  \n\nAlso, I've never eaten here, because hot dogs are generally not good.  Furthermore, I'm not sure why anyone would go to a hot-dog joint and expect good service.  So ignore anyone talking about hot-dogs and come here for the beer. Finally, parking sucks there's a lot of very busy restaurants and businesses on the same street, so expect to walk a little. The food is alright, but for the buffet price I will eat alright food over and over.  The lunch buffet is full of great food, with hot milky chai and multiple chutneys included.  The restaurant isn't clean, sometimes they take awhile to refill the steam trays, and it's kind of loud.  But it's cheap and decent.

{"text": "The mannequin in this place is really creepy and weird.  It throws you off because you would think that the place would be horrible if they keep the creepiness flowing, but it does give you something to talk about.  And amazingly enough the food is good, creative and the service is not bad.  I do notice that we have gotten newer, nervous server the last two times that I went.  Well, those were the only two times I have been.  She didn't screw anything up, but had to ask us many times it was o.k. to do this, or the other thing.  Not a big deal because she was nice and thorough.  We got the frog legs for appetizers and also the calamari.  Both item are breaded and not really that impressive.  I have actually had better calamari other places and the frog legs were kind of just o.k.  It was kind of a, hey, let me just try this for fun kind of thing because it is an exotic sort of item.  For my main I had roasted red pepper and basil pasta which was really quite good.  I really enjoyed it.  I think that alot of people would like the fact that Sam's has a wide, wide, in fact huge selection of menu items.  I don't always need an oversized menu.  Usually, if a place concentrates on a smaller range of things it comes out with better quality.  Sam's is bold in attempting to tackle all those items.  Most times I think that they pull it off.  My only gripe is that maybe they could change up the beers a little bit.  Maybe feature a few local offerings from small batch craft breweries.  Yah, they are always a good place to go for some solid eats.  Cheers guys! People's, not sure where the name comes from.....because it's for my peoples?  It's like soilent green, it's made of people?(movie reference)  I doubt that because their food is very yummy.  I am not sure of how the service is under pressure because everytime I go there they have about two other groups there and that's it.  That actually is kind of nice because it ends up being a relaxed atmosphere.  The owner is a really nice guy and makes sure his customers are well cared for at all times.  In case that wasn't enough the BYOB is free since last time I checked.  Usually you get charged extra per bottle, but not here.  So, the food is good, the \"people\" are nice, the food is cheap, the BYOB is free, how can you go wrong?  Awesome!! I have update my reveiw from last time on here.  While I have loved this restaurant for quite a while this evenings service was a bit on the slip shod side.  I think that it is a possibility that my waitress was brand new.  She was having trouble listening to what I ordered.  I thought carefully about what I wanted tonight and ended up just going with the old favorite of chana masala with some vegetable samosa.  She said, \"is that the chicken tikka masala that you want?\"  I said, \"no I would like the chana masala which is chick peas and vegetables with sauce and spices.\"  After it was cooked she brought me the chana masala with no samosa.  So I said, \"where is the vegetable samosa?\"  To this she replied, \"you just ordered the chana masala\" and I said, \"no I also ordered that with some vegetable samosa.\"  She did end up correcting her mistake and apologizing after she brought the samosas.  As far as the chana masala goes it was just o.k. tonight.  It had a tangy sauce with some decent spices, but not as much of a thick tomato sauce as I have had at other Indian restaurants.  I thought the portion size was very good because I did not go away hungry, but it was also a bit on the salty side.\n  As an aside I think that I am a bit more picky when it comes to dishes.  I am sure this waitress will get the hang of things eventually I would hope.", "user_id": "b0U5DL2NW6dpYoCdfZ1fHQ", "business_id": "XzaJf6WzpU7RsXTXzx72Xg"}
{"text": "I'm so glad we have the Food Co-Op in Pittsburgh. Although still fairly expensive, it's less than Whole Foods, and I don't do all my shopping here, just the things I have a hard time finding elsewhere. The bulk selection is one of the best I've ever seen, and I truly appreciate the salad bar on busy days. Their choices are more on the crunchy/hippie side than the high-end gourmet side of things, and it's nice to shop for vegetables without having to turn something down because it's not organic...most of the produce is. The staff is helpful and friendly, and, if someone doesn't know an answer to a question, which can happen with a volunteer, he or she will find out for you. On member 10% discount days it can get very busy, so go early or late. Namaste is not the best Indian food in the area, but it's the closest to our house, and we go for their lunch buffet, which I will rate as good, but not great. They almost always have that Indian buffet staple, channa masala, and maybe 2 or 3 other veggie dishes, a couple of meat selections, such as lamb curry or chicken tikka masala, and a cold salad bar with lettuce and raw veggies, pickles, chaat masala and raita. If you arrive early and not all of the items are out on the buffet, they bring it to your table, which is nice. Dessert is almost always gulab jamun and chai tea, which you help yourself to. On a couple of our visits, they had tandoor chicken wings, and they were to die for, but these aren't always available.  I would have rated this place 4 stars, but it can be inconsistent from visit to visit. Just to let everyone know, Namaste Indian Restaurant has moved (January 2013) from it's old location in the Banksville Plaza to 1150 Banksville Rd, adjacent to The Days Inn. I've notified Yelp. Maharaja is located in the Days Inn on Banksville Rd, and we tried it one day for lunch. Not really understanding the positive reviews here, but to each his/her own. I found the food watery, overcooked (even by Indian food standards) and tasteless. There seemed to be no care in preparation of the dishes, so that the vegetables weren't cut into the same sizes, each dish tasted much like the other, and the food didn't even look attractive. I don't mind divey surroundings, but I abhor a smelly old carpet, and they have wall to wall carpeting that was around before most of us were. They offer mango lassi which they keep in the original gallon plastic jug that they bought it in...at least pretend that you made it. There are 2 better Indian restaurants a stones throw from this place...Namaste and Mintt, both across the street. This is my favorite type of restaurant, regardless of cuisine; namely, a family run institution with great food, friendly service and an almost complete disinterest in spiffing up the surroundings. Yes, Pho Minh is a bit divey, and I relish this quality. The pho is great, as are all of the dishes I've tried here. I also have a deep appreciation for restaurants that do one cuisine and do it well...none of this Thai/Vietnamese/Japanese combo that only serves to confuse the diner as well as, often, the kitchen. Between this place and Tram's down the street, Pho Minh is my favorite. Pittsburgh has a woeful dearth of good restaurants...I'll try not to go on too much about that in my reviews, as I don't want your eyes to glaze over...so this is a destination restaurant for us. There are very few things more satisfying than a deep bowl of pho on a cold winter day.", "user_id": "F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA", "business_id": "-iVcmhjfq79QoTWzrb6pKg"}
{"text": "Overall experience was rather good. This is an impressive review for me to give a restaurant as I consider myself an avid foodie. It is rare for me to give an Italian restaurant a rave review, since I grew up eating Italian-American homemade meals. \n\nThe ambiance was nice, the buzz was slightly nosier than I would have liked but it was also not so much so to be considered bothersome. Their staff were attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. I will say, it was a little strange to not receive a menu until after we were served water and bread sticks. I can actually say I've never been seated at a restaurant where it took 15 minutes to receive one. However, after munching on the delightful breadbasket (The star of which is definitely the Focaccia bread) left me excited for what was yet to come. \n\nI enjoyed the affordable wine selection. We order an Italian table wine style Pinot Noir. It was delightful and we would order it again.\n\nFor an appetizer we shared the Capesante: grilled sea scallops, shaved fennel, red onion, orange and basil. My husband and I rarely go out to eat without ordering some sort of scallop dish.  I can proudly say, their scallops had a lovely sear and were cooked perfectly inside. \n\nFor my entree, I ordered the Lidia's Pasta Trio which is their signature dish.  Unlimited daily pasta selection served table-side. I must confess, I found the serving via table-side a little odd. If they served only my portion from the pan it would not have been as off. But thinking that others may have or will be served from that same dish that is inches away from the diner was a bit off. I had the linguine w/ walnut pesto which was average nothing too spectacular but good all around. The chicken, pork ravioli was interesting. Tastier that I expected. In fact, had I not tried my husband's entree I would have been more impressed with my ravioli. Lastly, it was served w/ eggplant penne in a red sauce. I was probably least underwhelmed by this last dish. But nevertheless, all three pastas far supersede the majority of Pittsburgh Italian restaurants. \n\nI order this with the Caesar salad and choice of dessert. The salad was okay. Admittedly, I'm a hard sell with Caesar as I prefer to make it myself. Unless of course I am eating it from Emeril's (Las Vegas) which was the best Caesar I've ever eaten. Bygones.\n\nFor dessert, I ordered the Torta d'Ananas- ricotta and butter cake, caramelized pineapple, Amarena cherries, and coconut ice cream. If I had to guess, the cherries were present in syrup form perhaps on the top of the cake. As I did not see any cherries (or taste for that matter) their presence within the dish. Perhaps the syrup was used sparingly. Nevertheless, the dish was yummy. The coconut ice cream with the caramelized pineapple was the star. However, I do not think it was spectacular enough to order again.\n\nMy husband had the Ravioli di Cinghale: ravioli filled with braised wild boar in a rosemary infused sauce. This dish was amazing. I could not believe how delicious every single aspect of this dish was. The ravioli looked so fresh, it appear made to order. Significantly, far exceeded the quality present in the Trio I ordered. The rosemary infused sauce was one of the most incredible sauces I have EVER eaten. The wild boar itself, was absolutely to die for. My husband and I swore we would be back, simply for us both to eat this dish again. It is a MUST HAVE. Enjoy! In sum, I very much enjoy this place. Hence the 4 stars. I probably order out from here 3-4 times a month. It is my 2nd most favorite Pho in Pittsburgh. I don't stray from my favorites dishes below, so I can't speak beyond what I will post. \n\nFor an appetizer, I order the Crispy Shrimp Rolls. Oh my! What little pieces of crispy, shrimp heaven. They are smaller shrimps, but the price is affordable so I don't mind. In my opinion what really drives this dish to excellence is the Vietnamese dipping sauce (nuoc cham). From what I learned about nuoc cham, every Vietnamese family has their own twist on it. The ingredients in nuoc cham are generally the same, but the proportions vary based on personal tastes and regions in Vietnam. According to Vietnamese cookbook author, Andrea Nguyen, \"as you move south the sauce gets sweeter, hotter, and more garlicky.\" YUMMY!\n\nI thoroughly enjoy the Pho Meatball entree. I LOVE fresh herbs and spices. Pho rice noddles served along side crunchy and light bean sprouts. Fresh cilantro and basil. I consider myself a Pho Meatball amateur connoisseur of sorts. I only order this dish, no matter where I eat Pho at. I like the way they slice the meatballs at this establishment unlike other places. It makes it easier to grab with the chopsticks =) Also they have less grisley pieces in this meatball Pho. I've never dissected them, but assume it is part tripe. The flavor is moderate with the slightest hint of kick. Also the lemongrass in the soup broth is so amazing. It is the epitome of Vietnamese comfort foods in my opinion. Coupled with the addition of Sriracha chile sauce and Hoisin sauce they include on the side is amazing. \n\nThe staff are polite and quick. One never waits long for your food. It is a little disappointing that they open for dinner so late. It would be nice to grab something right when I get off work versus waiting for 5pm to roll around. However, I cannot deny that it is most definitely worth the wait! Oh and like others have said, they are NOT OPEN on TUESDAYS. Odd, I know.\n\nThere are two things to be mindful of 1. If you are dining in- your portion size of Pho will be larger. This is not just at this Vietnamese place it is pretty much the norm for the other Vietnamese places around the PGH area. 2. Cash only. This last one is a major pain to me. I am not the cash and carry type of person.", "user_id": "MLZ9xHl8odrUaDbi1fzbAQ", "business_id": "XmdTkxKyJd7TuDLoiic1kg"}
{"text": "I took a group of 7 people here for a lunch meeting and as usual, the service and the menu was spot on. I ordered my favorite item, the oatmeal pancakes, which are nutty, fluffy and have a hint of sweetness. Like other reviewers, I just love those pancakes so much I can't seem to order anything else! The bottomless and pretty good drip coffee is a perfect touch that fits in the diner ambiance. \n\nOthers in the group ordered the veggie omelet, banana chocolate chip pancakes, eggs Benedict, the German potato pancakes, and a variety of other pancakes. The potato pancakes are delicious, with a hint of sweetness, touch of salt, and the requisite apple sauce/sour cream as an accent. I \"helped\" a friend eat these- they were very, very tasty. Good as those were, the regular pancakes are still the star of the meal. Everyone left full and satisfied, even on a very busy Friday at lunch. Challenging parking was a common gripe- make sure you bring change for the meters or else plan to walk quite a few blocks.\n\nI'll be back, and you can bet I'm ordering the pancakes again! Don't be fooled by the run-down exterior- this is a genuine beer hall that would make do nicely in any town in Europe. The decor is nothing to write home about, but the food is great. The dogs come in all varieties (bratwurst, all beef, turkey dog, veggie dog) and you can mix and match any topping your heart desires. Prices are SO reasonable, especially at a time when it's tough to find great food for a reasonable price in this city. The best feature of D's is their beer cave to the rear of the restaurant. While your dinner companions peruse the menu, make sure you stop and take a good walk through their beer selection. You can pick from hundreds of domestic and imported beers from around the world, including some rare gems you'd have to special order anywhere else. Chill your beer there in minutes, or get a discount walking in and bringing home a single or six pack. They always have interesting offerings on tap as well. Highly recommended! I keep coming back to this Bloomfield gem. The spicing is always fantastic, and the staff are wonderful. I have had a few experiences when the service was a bit slow, which would be my only complaint. Don't come and expect a quick meal unless you call ahead for takeout. However, they are BYOB, which has led to many memorable special occasion dinners for us here. Do yourself a favor and get the Bagan Bharta, and then try any of their saag dishes. The naan is divine and comes out crisped and perfect every time. The best deal for dinner is the vegetarian meal platter, which offers 2 entree items, rice, naan, raita, dessert, tea and pickles. I will be back. The food is so good, you'll dream about this place! I'll start with the \"bad\" stuff - the place is a small hole-in-the-wall, in an area that, at some times of day, may make you double-check that you locked your car. The restaurant is not the cleanest, nor is the menu the most extensive. HOWEVER...having traveled to Vietnam, and having been to a wide variety of Vietnamese restaurants around the US, this is certainly one of the most authentic. In fact, it reminds me of being in Vietnam. Are the spices on point? Yes! Delicious bowls of soup that should leave you with enough to bring home? Check! A couple cobwebs in the corner? Most definitely! An experience, to be sure. The place was about deserted on a Monday at lunch time, which was great for us - we got a window seat!\n\nWe started our meal with tea - this was your basic tea, nothing to write home about. We added on the spring roll with shrimp - and it was obviously freshly handmade to our order. Great appetizer to begin with - it's my barometer of a Vietnamese restaurant. This was a good one, not the best I've ever had, but quite tasty. I followed this up with a green papaya salad - heavy on the fish sauce (yum!) and covered in shrimp and peanuts. Very refreshing and light. My friend ordered the chicken curry with yam, which was creamy, freshly made (the veggies were not overcooked, as you find most places that premake lots of food) and not too spicy. I ordered the spicy vegetable soup with mushrooms. I'm not your average diner, and I like my spicy foods VERY spicy. This was maybe a 1-2/10. Pretty disappointing to me, but luckily the table was equipped with homemade Sriracha-like sauce and the ubiquitous chili-in-oil sauce found in cafes all over Vietnam. This solved the problem. The soup was fresh and filling. I will certainly be back again. There were tons of menu items I am dying to try!", "user_id": "ZqKg4O7EXci7SR_UUS2J_g", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw"}
{"text": "This place has the best beef lo mien I have tasted in Pittsburgh.  They cook to order so your food is fresh and isn't sitting out under a heat lamp.  My friend says the hot and sour soup here is the best she's tasted as well.  I like their pork egg roll but it is pretty different from others.  It is mainly vegetable (Cabbage I believe) and pork.  Their egg drop soup is pretty decent.\n\nI can't say I am impressed with their other dishes.  I've had curry chicken, shrimp fried rice, chicken soup, shrimp egg roll.  They were definitely edible just no where near as flavorful as the beef lo mien.  The chicken soup was horrible.  It was bland and the noodles were lo mien noodles.  Fried rice were ok but I've had much much better at other places.  They have a huge menu though so it'll take some time to go through them.\n\nThe obvious bad thing about this place is it is in a ghetto neighborhood.    It is probably not worth making a trip out there but if you're in the neighborhood, I'd say give it a try.  They're cheap and they give you tons of food.  It is cook to order so wait time might be a little long.  You can call in and order as well.  Not everything on the menu is the best but they have a huge menu to choose from. I wasn't expecting much but they surely over delivered.  I thought it was just another bar.  It had the bar vibe.  I didn't think the food would be this good.  I am impressed that most of the food is made in-house.  I actually don't remember what I got since it was several weeks ago that I went.  All I know was that the food was much better than any bar food I had.  I would come here again. 3.5 stars.  I've heard good praises about this place and stopped in.\n\nHad single slice with mushroom and pepperoni, mushroom steak hoagie, and cheese fries.\n\nThe single slice was good.  It was thin and has a good slight crunch.  Only thing I was disappointing in is that they used canned mushrooms (distinct color) which doesn't taste the same as fresh mushrooms.  But it was satisfying overall.\n\nThe hoagie was good.  Decent size for the price.  They still used canned mushrooms but it was still satisfying overall.  \n\nI wish someone told us how big the cheese fries were.  Three of us ordered one thinking it was a simple appetizer with cheese.  However, it is a huge giant box of fries with mozzarella sprinkled on it.  I am pretty sure it could feed 8 people.  It was also decent.  Needed a little bit of salt but basically fries and mozzarella. \n\nOverall, I found the experience average.  I would probably come back to try their pizza again. Why did I ignore this place for so long?  I keep hearing off comments about this place.  \"It's ok.\"  \"It's decent but other places are better\" \"It's not as good as what you're use to (I'm from California)\" etc etc.  So I was never interested in coming here.\n\nToday, I was working nearby and decided to stop in for the first time.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  I decided to give the pho dac biet and spring rolls a try.  I was happy to see a pot of jasmine tea waiting for me when I put down the menu.\n\nSpring rolls were good and was satisfying.  The pho has a nice light broth.  I like light broth.  Didn't feel too overly heavy and I can I feel I can enjoy it perfectly without hoisin sauce.  Portions were great and huge. The beef was good, it had chicken in it which I thought was good, and I am happy to say they use the good meatballs.  Other pho places I go to don't use the correct meatballs.  I finished my entire bowl.  \n\nThe place is small.  Restrooms are basically closets.  I get hit by the door every time I go into the restroom.  But hey, I found it to be clean.  \n\nThe decor was nothing special and they had Vietnamese music playing in the background.   They have the recognizable chairs that you see in most Vietnamese restaurants.  Everything about this place reminded me of home back in San Diego.  I felt the food was good and satisfying.  The people there were nice, checked up on us, and they were conversating with other guests even with their broken English.  I thought that was cute.  Prices here are a tad cheaper than other places.  Cash Only probably has to do with that. \n\nOverall, I found my experience here pleasant.  I liked the pho and I will definitely be back to give the other dishes a try.", "user_id": "fVnY5R9Wx8nhER6iWhcrsA", "business_id": "TyIsuojeKcTb4Acfg7xqew"}
{"text": "One of my favorite restaurants in the world.  \n\nExcellent atmosphere, fantastic food, great wine/drinks.  Menu changes up pretty regularly and I've never had a bad dish there.  The stuffed pork loin was one of my favorites.  Also they usually have a summer sangria (even in winter :) that is delicious. The scallops were also fantastic. The front patio/tent is open year round with heat lamps.\n\nRevision: \n\nI was just back at Casbah for a fundraising dinner.  Once a month they do a private dinner for a charity - for $100 there is a five course meal with wine flights.  All proceeds (not just the profits) go to the charity.\n\nMy dinner was so good, I literally almost cried.  The wild mushroom risotto was bar far one of the the best things I've ever eaten in my life.  Short rib ravioli was my 3rd favorite thing I ate that evening, but I found myself dreaming of it the next morning!  I had low expectations for dessert - it was a cornbread cake (weird!) but came with a blueberry compote and cream cheese ice cream.  The cornbread cake was an excellent balance between the sweetness of the ice cream and blue berries.  It was amazing!\n\nWhile I don't believe these are regular menu items, I highlight this because this was their charity dinner.  That they made NO money off of.  An area where they could skim on quality - but no - it was amazing.  Reaffirmed my belief that this is the best restaurant in Pittsburgh. Clearly based on other reviews, I should try this during daylight hours. \n\nWe went after a long night out, landing there around 2:30. I've been to plenty of late night places, after-hour bars, etc, but I've never been as scared as I was at Jo-jo's. \n\n2 fights broke out while we were there. First a group of guys, then their girlfriends. Then a guy at the next table threw up on the ground -some splashing on my leg. \n\nThen we heard police sirens and the fights were escalating - so we bolted. Maybe this is a rare experience? Anyway - I won't be heading back anytime soon! Oh this place.  \nThis is the greasy spoon that is sooo convenient it is worthwhile.  Would I travel more than 3 blocks for this place, probably not.\n\nWould I ride an elevator down and run over across the street in the middle of winter - without a coat - for it.  Of course.  \n\nI've done every combination of their salads - all solid choices.  And they are pretty flexible regarding adding/avoiding - so go  ahead ask.  (BUT - if they really wanted my opinion, I could write a dissertation on what they could do to improve their salad choices)\n\nWhen I'm having a horrible day at work and I can't stand the idea of a salad.  Their hamburgers are top notch.  They will frequently remind you that they won an award (ps none of the waitresses know which award).  But no joke - solid, straight up excellent burger and fries.  None of the glitz of every new burger place that has rolled into town - but really...This is a GOOD burger.\n\nThe decor...well it borders on the bad, but in the right light (dim) it's fine. It's a diner.\n\nWait staff is a surly bunch of no nonsense ladies, with an accuracy rating of about 85%, but I like them.  They mean well and they keep my glass of diet coke filled to the brim. Living near Groceria Italiana is like having my Italian family nearby.  Easy access to excellent food.  Homemade pasta, sauce, desserts, etc.\n\nTheir ready to eat food is delicious.  There is no reason a meatball sub should be a weekly part of my diet - but I can't help myself.  \n\nEveryone that works there is so helpful.  I've had a few parties catered by them - and they were overwhelmingly gracious.  \n\nI highly recommend stopping in this place to grab dinner - either for ready made food or their pasta and sauce.  You're about 10 minutes away from deliciousness.", "user_id": "dtd-wIGTJl7QVWpCA-3_Cw", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}
{"text": "Based on the menu, I would classify Cafe Zinho as more of a general fine dining restaurant rather than a Portuguese specialty restaurant. There are some Portuguese items, but I feel the emphasis is on providing high quality dishes non-specific to any particular cuisine.\n\nFor starters, we were brought corn bread which was great. It had a great textural contrast with the flakiness of corn bread along with the fluffiness of loafs.\n\nNext, we had frog legs in a lemon and white wine sauce. The sauce was very pleasant as it highlighted a contrast among bittery, buttery, and sweetness. We dipped many pieces of corn bread in the sauce. Most of the flavor of the frog legs came from the sauce. The frog legs themselves were very chewy. I suspect that they were prepared in an oven; I think quickly grilling or quickly deep frying the frog legs might yield a more pleasant texture.\n\nThe main entree was great! I had the filet of trout which comes with grilled vegetables. The grilled veggies were simple yet well executed. The trout was nicely seasoned and cooked. I was able to appreciate the taste of the fish as well as the light seasoning. I wish the trout's skin was a bit crispier; however, I want to emphasis the the fish was cooked very much to my liking.\n\nAll in all, the food was very good. The main entrees were quite pricey. You're likely to be spending at least $30 per person. I came here for a privately catered event with PITT Arts, so my experience was quite different from most patrons. We were served quesadillas, pizza, chicken with potatoes in a cream sauce, and a light pesto pasta. I only tried the latter two, but they were good. The dishes were catered to college students, so I couldn't expected the most culinarily complex dishes; however, other restaurants who have catered to this program have served us more impressive food.\n\nI'd be interested to return here for a late night experience because the restaurant/lounge has an open layout with peripheral seating which seems conducive to bumping into and then talking with people. A superb Mexican grocery store. It's a great place to pick up fresh tortillas and chips. They carry large selections of spicies, sauces, dried peppers, beans, and rice. They also carry cooking supplies such as molcajates (bowl used to make guacamole). I like that they usually have house made salsas and dips to try at the front of the store. The final kicker is the collection of pi\u00f1atas hanging from the ceiling. OOH is a cross between a British Pub and an old-fashioned American counter-top dinner. The decor provides a traditional feel (and so does its clientele).\n\nI decided on the Fish-n-Chips and was almost tempted to order a side too given the inexpensive prices which must be as old as the restaurant; the Fish-n-chips were $7.50. Given the price, I was a bit skeptical of the quality of the food but found myself content once I had a bite. Both the fish and fries were crispy and had a pleasant taste from the batter. My only complaint was that the fish came in three pieces as opposed to one large piece. \n\nAlso, OOH has a house-made pepper vinegar sauce which I decided to try. The basket was sufficient without the vinegar, yet I enjoyed it so much that I decided to generously apply it to. What Groceria Italiana does best is prepare Italian dishes such as lasagna, ravioli, and pasta for customers to reheat at home. I bought some meat, cheese & spinach ravilois to heat up at home. Your instructed to bake them for 45 minutes at 350 deg F on a layer of pasta sauce; if you follow these instructions, then they will come out great.\n\nI also picked up a bag of 12 perogies for $4 which are the best I have found at that price in Pittsburgh.\n\nMy favorite part is the deli counter where you can pick up both American and Italian specialty deli meats such as capicolla, prosciutto, and sopressata. The sopressata is housemade and fantastic.\n\nThe staff is very friendly and helpful. Don't hesitate to ask questions if you're unsure about something as they'll most likely be able to point in the right direction.\n\nI'll likely upgrade GI to four and a half stars when I am permitted to do so.", "user_id": "59A-ZxUMOgIl2MAnySh-Aw", "business_id": "l_Wey2YC6NvVUIH8vTygGg"}
{"text": "I'll preface this by reminding anyone who reads my reviews that 3 stars is a good review for me--it means it's good, but I'm not going to go out of my way for it.  \n\nEnrico's Tazza D'oro Cafe is definitely very good--I love the location in Highland Park, and the early morning crowd seemed pretty nice and very eclectic.  We even ran in to a friend while we were there and had a nice chat.  \n\nMy girlfriend and I ordered lattes which were excellent--the space was overall very nice inside and while the selection of pastries was a bit thin I would say the ones they had looked good.  I do wish they had more outdoor seating, though.  It's tough to make the \"I'm a fan\" list for coffee houses.  I'll try it again and may change my review in the future.  \n\nWhile I\"m on the note of Highland Park, I want to join the chorus of people who are dismayed by the recent hit and run involving the two bikers in Highland Park.  Accidents (no matter how horrible) do happen, and as such I'm not as angry about the actual accident;  but to just drive away and leave people severely injured by the side of the road is pretty wretched behavior.  At this point, i only hope that if you are the person who did this, you will at least dedicate the rest of your life to doing good to balance your to-date lousy behavior.\n\nIt's never too late. I am so happy they got rid of those awful bar stools!!!   We often choose not to walk in to Casbah without a reservation because the bar area was historically uncomfortable.  They have traded out the old stools that were screwed in to the floor, too far from your companions, and didn't comfortably turn to face people (who thought that was a good idea?) in for some admittedly less attractive but functional chairs,  I'm a big fan of the lunch and dinner there--we'll add that more often to our walk-in list now, It has all been said before--it's a great place to settle in for a beer.  The night I was there a couple of guys were performing music.  We had the wings--I would not call them memorable.  Again, a great view of the river and the city. Cheap, yummy, and down the street from my house.  Down side?  Anyone?\n\nI won't go in to the particulars--I agree with some of the comments below--I will remind people that it's BYOB (I really think Indian food tastes so much better with a beer) so come prepared.  \n\nI would not call it life-alteringly-good Indian, but I've found much of the food to be flavorful and the service has always been friendly, if a bit slow at times.  \n\nDecor is typical--seems like a kid-friendly place and good for large groups as well.  \n\nOh, and they're closed on Sundays, for which I'm happy for them, but I have to admit I would probably go more often if I could grab take-out on a cold sunday afternoon. . . (that's a hint if the owners are reading) This is good, stick-to-your-ribs-fill-you-up-at-the-buffet Indian food.  I work for Children's Hospital and it is by far the most convenient dining option in the neighborhood--walk in, grab a plate, fill it up at the buffet, eat fast, and out the door--all for about $8-$9, if I remember.  \n\nI would have to say that for real Indian food in and around Lawrenceville/Friendship, People's Indian is the better buffet & entrees--some of the buffet items at Taste are just not that flavorful, but overall it's serviceable and some items, like the naan, are actually quite good.  I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but for people in the 'hood, I would strongly encourage a visit.", "user_id": "u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw", "business_id": "83_p9vIqOq1TUIf3_GD7bA"}
{"text": "The espresso is definitely good. Although the interior is strange, the location is cute for Highland Park. \n\nMy beef is with the snarky Pittsburgh hipster Employee's that barely even engaged with my jokes made about their Beta Fish \"Vivian.\" Seriously, a boy Beta, named Vivian! That fish needs some recognition and love. After basically flirting with ourselves, it seemed like all they cared about was acting cool and barely providing an engaging espresso experience for me and my friend who were obviously excited to be there! \n\nNext time, maybe there will be different employee's. But I have a feeling their lack of enthusiasm for serving the general public will deter me elsewhere. Sad times Tazza, I felt like I could have really loved you. Well this was unexpected! \n\nAfter passing by Cafe Zinho for years and years I finally hopped into a hidden Portuguese oasis. Who knew the little hole in the wall near my old hair salon had such good food?! My friends and I had known long about it, but last night we were in need of a BYOB ($5 corkage) and found much more than that. \n\nWe started with two appetizers. (A very good tip from a fellow yelper!) One friend is majorly allergic to gluten and our fabulous waiter MORE than accommodated her questions and requests with patience. We all shared some kind of rice stuffed pepper that was moist and exploding with flavor, I forget the name...but definitely a must-have. We also were excited to try the pan-sauteed (not fried) calamari. I'm not a huge fried calamari fan, but this was swimming in olive oil and fresh herbs...it was a lovely delight away from a typically americanized version. \n\nWe also ordered the tomato bisque and the soup of the day. These were insane! The best soups I've ever had out. The soup of the day was a roasted creamy mushroom soup and I almost licked my bowl clean. The flavors were outstanding and we all couldn't decide which soup was better. Make sure to definitely soak everything up with their delicious table bread that seemed to have just come out of the oven every time they replenished our basket! \n\nSomething worth passing is yes, the salads...they're just okay. But my friends raved about their pork and I will not forget the visual of my friend picking up the bone to lick it clean while our waiter just laughed at us! :) \n\nBest part of the story? Well, the food takes a lonnggg time to come out, (warning, but probably because it is so fresh!) after finishing our bottle, our neighboring diners also took advantage of the BYOB but seemed to have left half of theirs when they were done! So after a silly little dare, we became the table of three that snuck 3 large pours of wine and placed it back on their table! Hey! Who was going to drink it anyways?! The little portuguese owner came over and was sincerely shocked at how the wine bottle was empty...she asked, \"Did you three drink this?\" We giggled and my friend's boyfriend said, \"YES.\" She smiled, and let us have our moment. \n\nWe left a big tip. She obviously didn't mind. And it's places like this that make me miss home! Let me explain to you something. I didn't know, until I moved 12 hours away from here, what a magical place Taste of India really is. I also didn't know, that when I fly into Pittsburgh, I would directly be driving from the airport to pick up take out before seeing my family. Helllooo! Here is your daughter you haven't seen in over a year, she comes reeking of curries and spices every-single-time! \n\nCan we start with the fact that the service here is spectacular?! My friends and I have been coming here for years. The owners are cute and funny and we are terrors when we are there because we bring large parties and we are so excited to order an entire table of plates.\n\nWhat fills our table? \n\nBooze, yes, they have beer.\n\nBread: Chapatti (Yummy Whole Wheat Goodness!)\n\nVeggie Options:\nPaneer Jalferji (Cheese and Veg)\nDal Sag (Lentils)\nPaneer Makhni (Cheese and Peas)\nChana Masala (Duh)\n*Personal Fav: Malia Kofta (These little fried vegetable balls with creamy tomato sauce and almonds!) --Haven't found this one anywhere else as good as theirs! Ah! I am drooling thinking of it. \n\nWhat do they do to this freaking food? I just don't know. Go soon! Ask for spice level of 7-8 if you want to tantalize your taste-buds with some fiery food and if you would like to ship me a container of the Malia Kofta I will be more than happy to message you my address.....\n\n\nOh, and my favorite date in Pittsburgh?

{"text": "I have been coming to Casbah for over a decade (pretty much since it first opened).  I very much like the place, and it has maintained its general character even as the head chefs have changed over the years.  Casbah is very good about continually updating its menu in an effort to stay current and relevant.  Over the years I have enjoyed many wonderful meals here including a fantastic orrechete (sp?) pasta with chicken and cranberries in a lovely cream sauce, and some of the best pork  chops (double cut)  I have ever encountered (although I no longer eat mammals, so they are likely to be the best pork chops I will ever eat).  \n\nThis is not an inexpensive place, it can be quite pricey for dinner.  One plus is that they have a very reasonable brunch on Sundays.  Their arugula salad during brunch with small diced potatoes and pancetta is fantastic.  My one complaint about the salad is that it needs a bit of acid. I always ask for a small slice of orange and then squeeze the juice onto the salad.  This cuts through the fat from the pancetta and makes the salad even more tasty.\n\nOthers may disagree, but even though this is a fairly fancy place, it is suitable for children.  Casbah has a semi outdoor seating area that is enclosed and heated even in winter.  My wife and I have often dined here with our kids.  This semi outdoor area is a bit more casual and absorbs the sounds of loud children fairly well.  You can bring kids without suffering the disdain of any but the most obnoxious of fellow diners. I can mainly attest to the ability of this place to provide semi-off the shelf catering solutions.  We host a party annually for Diwali, and usually have Naan and Chicken Tikka ordered from this place as appetizers and bread (we make the other stuff ourselves for the party--its part of the fun).  The Chicken Tikka and Naan are delicious and the service is great.  Regardless of who picks up the food, the owners usually invite the picker upper to enjoy some tea with them.  The people who run this place are lovely (the past few years have been tough with the demolition of St. Francis Hospital in front of them and the construction of a new Children's Hospital they have lost virtually all of their lunch traffic--construction workers not being the usual target market for Indian food joints.  Now that Children's is coming back on line, I expect them to reap the benefit.  This is a great place with very nice people running the place.  \n\nAs far as decor etc.  Do not expect too much.  Upscale Indian is still restricted to a few cities like New York, DC, Chicago, and San Francisco in the US.  My personal experience with upscale Indian is that you will in fact get delicate flavors, fusion and some interesting dishes...but in my mom's words, you will also get \"Indian food for the faint of heart.\" I have had Vietnamese food in Boston, DC, SF, Chicago, and Pittsburgh.  The Pho here is certainly on a par with the other places that I have sampled.  What sets Tram's apart for me are 2 things.  1.  The spicy prawn is really different.  I am not sure what it is that gives it its unique flavor and appeal but I have never had anything like it.  2.  The spring rolls are absolutely amazing.  I know that the spring rolls should technically be very basic--the ingredients are generally well understood etc, there are no real secrets etc.  For whatever reason, these are the best springs I have ever had.", "user_id": "q88CP93-o66z1c97fKLknQ", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}
{"text": "Meh.  Seriously?  Mediterranean?  What?  Sorry, but just because you serve scallops on babah ganoush doesn't make your restaurant Mediterranean.\n\nThis was kind of a disappointment, if you couldn't tell by my sarcastic tone.  The food was good, and I had a great time, but the food lacked the final eyebrow raising component that you come to expect with the bill that follows.\n\nThat said, the wine list was good and the prices were reasonable relative to the food.  Get the cheese course for dessert and you'll go home happy. This is probably one of the most solid restaurants we have on Pittsburgh's east end.  It is also a haven for the vegan/vegetarian hipster.  I've been a handful of times now and only once did I get food I wasn't happy with.  Prices are reasonable, maybe like $1-2 more for food than you would expect to pay.  Keeping this place open is well worth that cost.\n\nIf you aren't feeling so hungry, this doubles as a coffee shop (lacks some coffee shop seating) and the hot drinks are solid.  Check out the milkshakes! Went for lunch.  No one wanted to go in on a sushi platter so I had the spicy seafood udon.  Not sure what I was thinking, I generally avoid shellfish this far inland as a general rule... anyhow, it was a decent red broth with one scallop, two shrimp and one clam.  For $8.95 and a dollar more than the vegetable udon, I'm not complaining but it was not very spicy but the noodles were hot enough to burn my mouth!\n\nLarge, good for big groups.  Lunch service was okay, but not very attentive given how slow it was.\n\nAnyhow, I'd like to go back for the BBQ or sushi and hopefully have a 4 star experience. 1.5 stars.  I agree with Eszter, this deserves 2 stars only because of the service.  A sad little \"Chinese\" buffet with a smattering of overcooked options.  Soups were borderline offensive.  There probably won't be a wait! Pretty straightforward little pittsburgh pizza joint. Hoagies, Salads, Pizza, Calzone. Prices are reasonable, especially if you go in a pie with someone else.\n\nWe had a couple different pizzas. I would give them 3 stars. Thinner crust, not quite as chewy as I like it. Toppings and sauce were bordering on sparse.\n\nService gets five stars. They did a great job handling a pretty busy lunchtime rush. The place is well lit and very clean for this kind of pizza joint, so I'll give them five stars for that, as well. There's an upstairs dining room and some downstairs seating with a bar. Also, outdoor seating. I have only had the lunch buffet, which really isn't fair to write a review off of.  While cheap and I would consider a good deal, it was overall greasy and bland.\n\nOnce I go back and order something off the menu I will have to re-review. I am really conflicted about this place.  I always have a great time when I go, the prices are reasonable (especially vegetarian) and the staff are super friendly.\n\nThat said, the food is OK.  It lacks some of the fresh condiments that I have grown so accustomed to with Vietnamese (basil, cilantro, mint, etc).  If you're looking for something to warm your soul on a 5 degree Pittsburgh day, this will do it.\n\nBYOB before 9, no corkage fee. I am also somewhat conflicted about Tram's.  I have been a few times now, and it seems to be somewhat hit or miss.  I've had the Pho a few times, and while always fairly good my satisfaction largely hinges on the amount and freshness of basil and mint that is brought out.  The other dishes are usually well made and well seasoned.  \n\nI enjoy the short menu and the waiter who is fun to interact with.  This place is usually pretty busy even on a weekday evening.  Surprising given the location.  Definitely better than Pho Minh up the street, but I still think Spice Island has the best Vietnamese dishes in town.", "user_id": "Q6PGJ1UylVz9bby8wQqEPg", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}
{"text": "Food: There are countless options to choose from for vegetarians or carnivores, but the food is only so-so.  We've ordered takeout numerous times due to proximity, and nothing has been bad, but nothing has been special.  The general Tso's tofu and the Moo Shu vegetables are the best things we've ordered.  The eggplant was soggy and not great.  The portions are large.  Nothing is particularly spicy even if it is mentioned as being spicy on the menu.\n\nPrice: Tasty is cheap.  \n\nDrinks: N/A\n\nAtmosphere: Typical Chinese takeout place.  A photo of every single meal they offer is on the wall.  Located in the plaza next to Pizza Parma.  Decent location for that end of Shadyside.\n\nService: The employees speak poor English but can usually understand what you are askingt/telling them.  The food is usually ready for takeout within 10-15 minutes.\n\n(+): many options, cheap, ready quickly\n\n(-): food is nothing to write home about\n\nWould I go back again? If I'm feeling too lazy/broke to go anywhere else. Food: menu will appeal to vegetarians and non-vegetarians, with daily dinner specials, separate lunch (sandwiches) and dinner (entrees) menus, both soups were vegetarian (according to the waitress, never heard of vegetarian minestrone before), I ordered penne with multiple veggies and a white wine sauce, it was above average but not great, soup was good, a bowl of bread sticks was on the table and replaced regularly, salad was average size and quality\n\nPrice: dinners range from $12-18 with most toward the higher end of that range, not expensive, but the quality of the food probably deserves the lower end of that scale\n\nDrinks: BYOB\n\nAtmosphere: sports bar-family restaurant type setting, with pictures of athletes all over the wall, but better than sports bar quality food and service\n\nService: waitress refilled water many times, was on the ball and timely, answered all questions about the menu\n\n(+): good service, reasonable prices, good but not great food\n\n(-): nothing wrong with Legends, but also nothing spectacular\n\nWould I go back again? I wouldn't drive to the North Side to eat here, but if I was in the North Side, it would be at the top of the list, particularly if friends/family were at AGH (directly across the street). Food: Tram's is one of the true hidden gems in Pittsburgh and serves The best Vietnamese food the city has to offer.  Fans of Vietnamese food surely know Tram's by now, but those who haven't tried yet need to.  The menu offers appetizers, meat, seafood, and vegetarian options.  But there's no reason to order anything but the Pho.  There are many options, but keep it simple.  Pho real.  It's unbelievably tasty and filling.  One bowl will have you stuffed, but if you have a massive appetite, the spring rolls are also huge and delicious.  \n\nPrice: One person can gorge themselves with tip included for under $10.  The prices here are ridiculous considering the quality and quantity of the food being served.  If you're on a budget, this should be a regular stop.  It should be regardless.\n\nDrinks: the Thai iced tea is good, all regular drinks are offered, no booze\n\nAtmosphere: If Tram's was to be criticized in any way, surely this would be it. The dining room is almost but not quite dirty, and likely hasn't changed in 10+ years.  What some may see as a blemish others may view as character (me).  Hey it's Tram's Kitchen, and we're just eating there.  Wear a blindfold, you'll still taste the remarkable food.  Cash only.\n\nService: A waiter will be to your table with water before you even hit the seat, and another will be over for your order within 60 seconds.  Thats why you just order the pho.  There's no wasting time at Tram's.  Sit down, order, food comes quick, bill shortly after, eat, go home.\n\n(+): Tram's is a can't miss restaurant in Pittsburgh.  The only way to miss it would be driving past it without realizing because its so small and indistinguishable on Penn Ave.  The food and price are unbeatable.\n\n(-): Some may be slightly turned off by the atmosphere.\n\nWould I go back again?

{"text": "I don't understand why I keep wanting to go back here. Maybe it is the large plate of food and blue corn bread that comes with the Carnitas Enchiladas, my preferred dish. Or maybe it is the kiwi margarita during happy hour, even though it gives me heart burn. I always leave this place thinking the service was mediocre, the food was standard, and that I probably should not have ordered 2 margaritas. I usually feel so stuffed I walk out like I am being pulled from my stomach. I usually need to sit in my car for a few minutes before I can drive away due to how stuffed I feel. I hate feeling this stuffed but I always order the Carnitas Enchiladas and never finish it. \n\nAlso, their chimi is frozen. I once asked if they could not put in the mushrooms and they revealed they freeze them, claiming this needs to be done to deep fry it. Not sure how truthful it is, but being a chain and freezing meals is not what I like in a restaurant.\n\nThe noise level in this place seems to be high, as in blasting pop music so loud it drains out other tables' conversations and makes you shout to the person in front of you. This is more often than not, yet sometimes it is not that loud. \n\nThey have outdoor seating which I say I want every time but when I peak around the corner before entering it reminds me of an outdoor bar or party. People standing at their table or over the fence railing with their drinks chatting. Not the atmosphere I prefer for dinner. \n\nSome notable mentions are that the black beans are spicy, just how I like and the kiwi margarita is very tasty. \n\nI give this place 3 stars because I feel it is mediocre and standard. Plus I always walk away paying more than I want, or think they deserve. I use to love this place. Every time I would want something very good and on the cheaper side I would come here. I would get the rice noodle soup with chicken every time. It tastes so good especially with lime juice and Thai basil. It is the candy of soups, or at least I think so. However, I went once and I must have felt too adventurous and ordered some type of noodle dish, I forget the name. The chicken looked pan seared but it was room temperature and the rest of the dish was cold, which did not mix well with the chicken. It was covered in a clear broth and lettuce was piled high. This could have been normal for the dish, but I just did not like it and the chicken weirded me out. I gave my leftovers to my boyfriend who said he enjoyed it...but I am pretty sure he will eat (almost) anything. \n\nI gave this place 4 stars because the service is terrible. The food does come out quickly but if you have a question about the menu, forget it. The waiter either does not understand or does not care to answer. Also if you do not know what you want when the waiter gets to your table he seems upset/mad even though they could gave you 5 minutes to look over the menu. Once when I was there they made a large party of 5+ move tables once they were seated with their drinks to squeeze in a table for 2. That was definitely entertaining to watch, but it was just bad service in opinion. \n\nAnyways, this place has the best  soup I tasted in Pittsburgh. Just make sure you know what you want when you get there and don't mind sitting in close proximity to other diners! \n\nOh and the spring rolls and peanut sauce are delicious and tastes fresh. mmmm....", "user_id": "2bHyfK2wurjRQIzO5VhLmA", "business_id": "hhNlQWaKqGbMPoeZHoL-IQ"}
{"text": "D's quite possibly has the best beer selection in Pittsburgh. There are always 20 micro brews on tap and they rotate seasonally. Last time I went they had a variety of pumpkin beers and I pretty much tried them all to figure out which I liked best. If you aren't feeling any of the beers on tap then take a stroll to the walk in cooler in the back and take your pick of hundreds of bottles. Bring the one you like back to the bar and the bartender will open it for you and bring you a glass. \n\nThe bartenders are really chill, and though the service isn't overly attentive, it is perfect for the vibe of D's. And speaking of the vibe, D's has this old pub style feel with the walls meeting at strange angles making cool little nooks and crannies where you can sit and sip your beer with friends or maybe just read a book.\n\nD's is also known for their hot dogs, and while good and inventive, in my opinion are a little overpriced. For some reason I have trouble spending $5 for a hot dog. I've tried their wings and fries too, both good standard bar food, but again a tad overpriced. My friend and I drank beers (a good amount) and ordered food and our tab was $100.\n\nD's still remains the gem of Regent Square and is worth the pilgrimage to Beer Mecca if you have never been. The bar has a nice selection of beers. The Irish bartender who works Monday nights is extremely welcoming and friendly.  \n\nFor food I tried the raw bar happy hour. The oysters were alright but nothing special. The shrimp were quite small, probably U-20 count which for Shrimp Cocktail is tiny. The wings were very disappointing. Extremely small and flavorless. And finally the steamed clams were CHEWY. \n\nIn recap, come here for the beers and the nice bartenders. The food you can do without. Bloomfield has some hidden gems and Nico's is one of those kind of places that is getting less and less common around the 'burgh. It's not a gastropub, it's not bohemian, Nico's is just an old time bar/restaurant that makes me nostalgic for a time before I was even born. \n\nI always come here on Monday nights for the wing special. It's something like 24 wings for 8 bucks which is not a bad deal. There are definitely better wings around the city, but I still keep coming back to Nico's. Maybe it has to do with the friendly atmosphere (seems to be a family run place), and the divey feel. The location is great as it just pops up in the middle of a residential section in the heart of Bloomfield.\n\nThe patrons are always friendly, and on more than one occasion I've had random people start chatting me up like we've known each other for years. If you are feeling adventurous try out karaoke night on Saturdays, its always good for some laughs and fun times.\n\nLong live the old school joints in Pittsburgh, I hope you last forever. Great hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese joint. They serve all the standard fare, pho, split rice, vermicelli. I usually get the split rice dish with pork and at 8.95 the portion is very large. The only thing I've been slightly disappointed with at Tram's is the spring rolls. They weren't as fresh as I was hoping and some of the produce was slightly wilted. \n\nIt seems to be a family owned place, the service is quick, and the food comes out even quicker.", "user_id": "ukrBUZXE5K1J57FI7ve_RQ", "business_id": "2X5G4Ujq0s4Wfn4TC7gX0g"}
{"text": "I came for the Sunday brunch prix fixe menu - you get one appetizer and entree with a classy cocktail. I made reservations online a few weeks in advance, and the restaurant, even with decent indoor and large outdoor (with heat lamp) seating, became pretty packed. \n\nFor the appetizer, I was able to try the Granola, Fruit and Yogurt, the Tomato & Basil Bisque, and the Mushroom and Celery Root Puree, and all were equally delicious. The mushroom and celery root puree I was a little wary of, but it was delicious. \n\nFor the entree, I tried Steak and Egg, Sea Scallop Fry, and the Braised Lamb & Eggs. The portions were substantial and the flavors were all there. The runny yolk with the steak and lamb were glorious. They also have other standard brunch entrees, such as a benedict and waffles, but I felt like this was something you can get anywhere.\n\nOverall, really satisfied with the brunch we had. The outdoor seating was beautiful, and the heat lamps kept us pretty warm in the winter. This is a 5-star neighborhood pizza delivery joint. I've ordered from here multiple times, and the quality was consistent and the delivery was timely and friendly. The food comes hot, and they never forget to give utensils, condiments and napkins.\n\nI've ordered the Wings with Garlic and Parm, which comes in a oven-safe container for leftovers. The Buffalo fries are great as well- and if you top it with cheese you also get the aluminum container. We all know food tastes better when its reheated in the oven.\n\nThe Chicken Ranchero Pizza is great, but I feel pretty guilty about eating it, so I just order regular pizza with random toppings that I'm in the mood for. My other favorite item is the Cheesy Breadsticks.\n\nConsistent, delicious quality with reliable delivery=5 stars. I've walked by the store itself- it's a takeout place. I was excited to check this restaurant because of the reviews and my love for carbs. I also saw that it was on Triple D, though usually those pursuits end up being disappointing. \n\nMy friend and I split the Raspberry-stuffed French Toast and the Spinach, Tomato and Feta Omelette. We got sides of Bacon, Home Fries and Toast. I thought the Omelette was great- ingredients were fresh, and it wasn't as greasy as I thought it would be. The Home Fries were my favorite since they were more like smashed potatoes, and it was different from your typical diner home fry. The Raspberry-stuffed French Toast was a disappointment. It wasn't stuffed at all- it was thickly breaded (maybe crushed corn flakes?) and drenched in raspberry sauce. The dish overall was OK, but not worth the hike from home. My friend also got the tomato juice- couldn't really tell if it was freshly juiced or not.\n\nThough I am curious about their pancakes, this visit wasn't worth it for me to make the 20-25 minute drive out here. The service was fast and efficient, not particularly friendly, which is fine with me. The meal was very affordable. Does this place have the best Vietnamese food I've ever had? No. But does it hit the spot? HELL YES! \n\nThis was our go-to for hangover pho in college. Coming back the Pittsburgh after trying countless Vietnamese resturants, I was afraid to try the food again. I thought that the great taste I remembered was more of a memory and lack of food savvy-ness than anything else.\n\nHowever, Tram's did not disappoint. The rough-around-the-edges owner is still there, pumping out customers.\n\nThe pho lacked a little depth, but satisfied the craving. The portion was bit small for the price (Vietnamese is dirt cheap, even in NYC), but fine. The lemongrass tofu was a little on the salty side, but very tasty! The spring rolls, like everyone has mentioned, is packed with goodies inside.\n\nMy favorite dish of the night was probably the Split Rice dish. It comes with shredded and grilled pork and a lovely egg with runny yolk on top. The fish sauce that comes with it is sweet and delicious.\n\nHardly a wait on Saturday night? BYOB?

{"text": "This is one of those places I really want to love. You walk in, it is super cute, nice ambiance, friendly staff, people are reading and talking... None of these are bad things. I got a regular coffee black and a sandwich, which came close to $15. A little pricey but whatever. The sandwich was just gross. Old bread that was just past stale to the gummy gross stage, almost no toppings and some weird spread (it was the mushroom sandwich). The coffee was just a little off. I couldn't put my finger on why, but it didn't seem right. Then I looked into the back room.... There is bread stacked EVERYWHERE. No wonder mine was stale. I might go back for coffee in a pinch, but I wouldn't get food there again. Let me first say that I have been a vegetarian for 15 years and have never been to a veg restaurant before. Looking through the menu here I actually got excited, because I didn't have to ask \"does this have meat in it\" a million times. THERE WERE SO MANY CHOICES! I have the excitement of the little girl on Despicable Me \"It's So FLUFFYYYY!\" \n\nMy excitement aside, the menu was pretty large for all veg food. They have breakfast all day, which is always ok with me. Prices were average (~8.50), and portions were large enough to provide lunch for the next day. (Although I have heard that the Cuban Sandwich is on the small side).\n\nI had the Banh Mi, which was fabulous. The bread was fresh, aioli was nice, vegs were pickled just right, but the tofu was a little on the dry side (on next day lunch reheat it was perfect). I was surprised by the veg seisage. It was really good. \n\nGazpacho was nice, although I am not really a fan of cold soup. It reminded me of a smoother salsa. Good, but just not my thing.\n\nSarah S. had the special, home fries with chili and cheese.  This was on the spicy side (a good thing) and came with tortilla chips. She was happy with it. \n\nLatte's are good too.\n\nAll in all this was a good experience! I think this is my new favorite place. Pickles looks like a dive. The bathroom is a disgrace to mankind. The clientele...or should I say the non-client, just sitting there bothering paying customers, are a little off putting. \n\nBUT, the food is awesome... I would not want to look too closely into the kitchen... but the food is awesome! The beer cave is amazing, and you get $1 off each bottle if you take out... Which means that some of them end up being cheaper than if you bought a case! WOW. \n\nThe food is really good. I have been here several times, and each time, I told the server to bring me something vegetarian. I have never been disappointed!! From hotdogs, to seitan, to nachos everything here tastes great and there are tons of options. \n\nThe last time I was there we were having fun upstairs playing darts and racking up a tab. The bartender was nice enough to actually stop us and point out that it had started to snow, and we should probably leave before the roads got bad... I thought that was super sweet and nice of him!! Ok, so this place has the whole soup nazi feel. You get a little rushed when they are busy, and I get the feeling that the guy gets a little pissed if you take too long to decide. That being said, the food is awesome (if you can forget about the little food inspection mishap), the waiter has mad skillz, and if it's not busy he is also pretty cool to talk to.

{"text": "It's not really super-convenient for me to go to the strip unless I have a plan and a few things I want.  Coming from Shadyside means I need to get in my car and drive, and I don't really like parking in the strip, and then it's always super-crowded on the weekends, etc. etc. etc.\n\nBut for a chorizo burrito from that taco stand? I would travel to the ends of the earth for one of those! \n\nReyna Foods is one of those places that makes me really wish that Pittsburgh would have a street food revolution.  Every popular part of town should have food carts.  They're quick, convenient, and delicious.  Reyna is hopefully a trend setter, and definitely a hard act to follow.  \n\nThe folks who run it are always smiling, and are pretty dedicated to making sure you get your food exactly the way you wanted it.  I personally like my burrito \"con todo,\" except for sour cream.  The hot sauce they put on it? Fantastic.  A burrito from this place is a solid, high-density mass of stomach-filling bliss.\n\nAnother upshot is it's not like any other burrito you're going to get in town.  It's a great combo of fresh and rich flavors.  \n\nThere are only two complaints I have, and there's only one REAL complaint I have.  The real complaint is that the line sometimes gets really long, and it takes a while to get served.  The fake complaint is that it weirds me out a little that they toss the burrito in the microwave for a bit at the end (seems like a Sheetz move to me,) but it really don't affect the quality of the food, so who cares?\n\nAs for the store itself? I don't really have enough experience with it to say much.  But try the taco cart ASAP! I'm no expert on Vietnamese food, but methinks the folks who are all \"OMG I AM FROM (name a coast) AND THIS PLACE IS TERIBEL OMG OMG OMG!!!!\" need to put a plug in it.  If it's so great there, STAY THERE! We don't want to hear it.  Nobody logs into Yelp and says \"Well, Tram's sucks, guess we have to go to BOSTON now to get Vietnamese food.\" \n\nNow, the review.  \n\nI am a curry monster.  If a country makes a curry, I want to eat it, and once I've eaten it, I want more.  Not all curries are created equal, but the curry you get at Tram's is pretty damn good.  And that's why I go there, but it's not the only reason to go there.\n\nThe spring rolls are pretty good, as well.  What I like about them is that they're fat, and packed tightly.  You have to appreciate it, because it is no easy task to wrap one of those things really tightly without ripping the skin.\n\nThe service is sort of no-frills.  They're not overtly friendly, but definitely not rude either.  Just quick and businesslike.  I love the ambiance, too, because it reminds me a lot of east Asia.  Cheap tablecloths, pastel-painted walls, and until recently, it was organized in such a way that your table and the folks next to you were so close together you may's well have been dining together.\n\nWhat's a real complaint about this place? It's what I say about every place that's cash only.  They need a credit machine. Any establishment that's open 24 hours gets bonus points in my book.  It's my firm opinion that any business that serves customers on a walk-in basis should be open 24/7.  I mean, yeah, there's that circadian rhythm thing that keeps every business from having the graveyard shift, but I'm sure we're only a couple decades away from curing the need for sleep.  Point is, Ritter's is 24 hours, and as a result it's been a standby ever since I moved into town.\n\nThe food at Ritter's is definitely better than what you'll get at a Denny's or a King's.  It isn't top-shelf, artisan food, but it is pretty good diner food.  Ritter's is also a great place to go hang out with a few friends late at night, and BS over coffee when you're just not feeling going to a bar and blowing mad cash on drinks.  Or for stopping by after you've already blown your mad drink cash.\n\nThe waitresses are nice.  The fellah who usually rings us out was really rude to me at least once.  I think he was the owner or manager or something, too.  But I'm not really sure.\n\nThe place is cash-only, too, which sucks.  However, the fact that they're cash-only leads to a really encouraging story about the place: one time the ATM did something wacky and I thought I may have been charged without having received my cash.  The waitress took down my name and phone number, which I thought was just to get me to stop complaining, but sure enough someone called me the next day and gave me the run-down on what had happened.  I'd call that good service.\n\nIf it's late and you're peckish, don't forget that Ritter's is open.", "user_id": "qPGLUQUG43b3aBZKDUBlMw", "business_id": "buVALudg30kgkDusqB3yJw"}
{"text": "This is the place to get a great slice of sicilian pizza. \n\nMy co-workers and I agree that this is one of the best sicilian slices in the city. Crispy and airy crust make the enormous slices not too heavy and they hold a lot of toppings really well. Plus their sauce and topping choices really round out this pizza. Their regular NY style slices are decent, but I would definitely go for the sicilian. \n\nThe hoagies are all pretty good too, as a good Italian place should do. Not the most veg-friendly place. Other than the toppings on the pizza, they serve a side salad, which is mostly iceberg lettuce, and they put deli ham on the salad, which in my opinion is completely unnecessary. Seems like they are just serving to the over meaty and under-vegged Pittsburgh eaters (who whould be confronted with more good veggie dishes more often). But their homemade Italian dressing is great. \n\nService is great here. It's family run and the Grandmother and Mother waitress, always with a smile and friendly banter. Seems like Papa and son are in the kitchen serving up the food. Plus there is outside seating which is often available even on crowded days in the square. \n\nLooks can be deceiving, because I don't think I would have ever checked this place out by just looking at it from the outside, or inside for that matter. A good recommendation from a friend got me here, so hopefully it works for you too. First of all, this is some of the BEST pizza in the burgh. It is certainly my favorite. Their sandwiches and other options are also very good, and be sure to try the Pide, turkish pizza. \n\nThe first few times I had the pizza, we had ordered it to our office, so I hadn't been to the space. At one point, my co-workers and I tried to go to the shop, and were confused / not aware that is was on the second floor, and the elevators were not working, or something. It's kinda frustrating because we just never made it to the place, and I missed out on this delicious pizza for an entire year after that. \n\nBut when I finally made it to the place, it reminded me of a college dorm rec room that happened to sell pizza. Random furniture, a large tv playing soccer with foreign commentators, complete with a ping pong table and vending machines. \n\nThe staff is friendly and service is quick, but not too quick. It is pretty clear that they make everything to order. And it's all delicious. It's hard not to give this place and extra star just for sentiment. Honestly Ritters is a favorite of mine. I love diner food. If you're looking for a late night, drunken fourth meal, this is your place. If you just want a no frills, greasy spoon, Saturday brunch, Ritters is there for you.\n\nThis place is blocks from where I live which makes it even better for me, and it is open 24 hours! One of the only places in town, or at least on the East End that holds that title. Perfect for those of us that frequent Bloomfield, Shadyside and Lawrenceville for late night fun. I can't tell you how many times in group of friends looking to satisfy their drunk munchies (or otherwise) in the wee hours that RITTERS!! is shouted. It's there, it's open and ready to serve you anything from it's extensive menu of diner food. \n\nIt's also good anytime, to go in and watch the old yinzers on a Saturday morning, drink their coffee, read the paper and just being so Pittsburgh. Served by waitresses in their nurse scrubs that always call you 'hun.'\n\nThe food - I have never had a problem with the food. I love breakfast and I don't think I have gotten anything else here. I think maybe my sunnyside eggs were undercooked once - but that has happened to me at really nice restaurants too, and eggs just seem to be something that is done wrong fairly often. I think their hotcakes are pretty darn good and that is my go-to meal. A great hangover cure, always.", "user_id": "XM8xoYr14IaiZ7gLQ9ARpw", "business_id": "DhDNNHZtaBxYNSqJz64ixg"}
{"text": "I've never actually been to the restaurant, but despite the plethora of pizza joints in the area (and believe me, we've sampled a LOT), this is the only place from which my Partner In Cuisine and I will order hoagies.  Even when they got our order wrong once, they were quick to fix it and deliver the replacements within a few minutes.  I can honestly say that the many times we have ordered from Pizza Perfectta, we have never actually had the pizza (but I hear it's good).  We just keep gravitating back to those hoagies! The Partner In Cuisine (PIC) and I had an early dinner there recently thanks to Groupon and we were not disappointed.  Since we weren't sure what to get and were just generically hungry, we decided to just let the menu decide for us and we ordered one of each of the highlighted items on the menu - the \"house specials\" according to our server.\n\nThe calamari was excellent and it was apparent that it had been hand breaded.  The Asian fusion made for a delicious alternative to the typical calamari that was reminiscent of a General Tso's squid.  The main dishes were also good, but nothing in particular stuck out about them.  I also had a red-velved martini which I thought was probably the best part of the meal.\n\nOverall, I would definitely go back on a weeknight for happy hour or on a Tuesday to try the variety of mini martinis, but I think I'll leave paying $9 for an alcoholic beverage to \"special\" nights and not just a typical weekend dinner.\n\nThey do lose a star because even though we were one of three occupied tables and a few taken seats at the bar, the service was incredibly slow.  It took so long for our appetizer to come out, I began to question whether the cook had to get in his car and go down to Wholey's to buy more squid. Prior to writing my review for Primanti Bros., I put on my helmet, tooth guard, started my car and prepared to run away once the angry hordes of Pittsburghers read my review...Why you ask?   Get ready for it....deep breath...\n\nI...don't...like...Primantis...\n\nGasp!  Choke!  Faint!\n\nYes, yes, I know.  As a born and bred Pittsburgher, I am committing blasphemy by admitting I don't like Primantis.  I don't like their sandwiches, I don't like their nachos, I don't like their soups, salads, wings or fries.  I find the whole idea of a sandwich containing 3,000 calories worth of Italian bread, cole slaw, meat, and fries just too over the top.  The fries are a soggy mess, the slaw has too much vinegar, the meats are cheap, and the bread is...well the bread is actually ok.\n\nI know it's a Pittsburgh institution and it even served a very pragmatic purpose back in the day, but now it's just kitsch that gets the city featured on Food Network on occasion.  I've eaten there numerous times and have done my Pittsburgh duty of taking all out of towners to the (in)famous Primanti's, but always with the caveat that, \"It's not that good.\" and usually an apology afterward.\n\nSo there you have it.  I do feel like a giant weight has been lifted off of my shoulders.  I no longer have to carry around my terrible, terrible secret. Do you need a place to soak up the alcohol after a long night of drinking?  Do you like being served by a grizzled waitress in a nurse's top who has smoked a pack a day since she was 12?  Do you enjoy old school diners and mediocre food at low prices?  If you answered \"yes\" to any of these questions, Ritters is the place for you!  \n\nThe PIC (Partner In Cuisine) and I have eaten there a few times, but those times were really out of desperation because nothing else was open.  Given all the food selections in the area, I can safely say that Ritter's isn't the #1 choice for most people, but it fits the bill when you need something hot to eat.  I'm sure the PIC and I will find ourselves back there before too long.", "user_id": "e7iHB7gZbVuD-UvJVKe3cQ", "business_id": "lHP5STO7aomlEQixH8m1aA"}
{"text": "From reading the other reviews, I see this place was on some top 25 places in Pittsburgh list a few years ago.  I haven't seen it myself, but have known of this place for a while before my first visit in 2013.  It wasn't until my almost 80yo buddy, Mr. Italo Donatucci (world's coolest old Italian dude) brought me one of the best fish sandwiches I ever had that I became hooked!  I've had at least 10 since then, but only during the Lent season.  I gave my 5 rating based on the fish sandwich alone.  Try it without a bun also!  Either way you get 3 nice size pieces of fish equal to a pound.  You can have your choice of sides, but I always get the small mac n cheese for my side.  The staff is always really friendly and service is prompt.  It's in a rough neighborhood, but the Rankin police station is right across the street.  Almost every visit there I have seen police officers inside mingling with the locals or picking up lunch orders.  Soon I plan to make a visit that's not a Friday during Lent to try other menu items. Something about the sauce makes me like their pizza.  I think it has a sweet taste to it.  They'll make special requests if you ask them.  Customers and accompanying foot traffic outside is a bit rough in this area of the northside lol.  I like the old school crane arcade machine near the counter.  Dining area is a bit small.  Sometimes doesn't seem like the cleanest joint around, but works for me! I wish there were more small neighborhood grocery stores around like Donatelli's.  I've shopped here for many years, but more so in the last couple of years.  I like coming here for the fish sandwiches and other prepared foods.  They serve a wide variety of Boar's Head deli meats.  I've noticed that lunch meat bought from here doesn't last very long once you get it home.  I think maybe it's the deli counter where the meats are displayed and unwrapped that keeps them from being their freshest.  Be sure to read the signs out front and back by the deli for weekly sales and specials.  You can find good deals throughout the store on all your favorite items.  I never do any major grocery shopping here, mostly lunch trips for my coworker and I.\nToday I bought two 1/2lb fish hoagies, 2 juicy Sunkist oranges, one roma tomato, a bag of pretzel rods, a big bag of Wise potato chips and a 1/2 gallon of Turner lemonade all for $10 and change!  Try buying all that at Giant Eagle for cheaper...won't happen!!\nPretty small inside, so no room for shopping carts. Grab a basket by the door.  I noticed today that they have a wide selection and good prices on olive oil, which often seems overpriced to me.  You can usually find the staff hard at work around the store while shopping.  Everyone is friendly and helpful.  Back at the deli counter they know me as the guy who always tips for service.  I give 2$ everytime a friendly face waits on me :)  I can tell they don't get tips often because they always express their gratitude for my kindness.  The store is convenient for Bloomfield locals who might be in walking distance.  There is no private parking, so grab a spot on Liberty and check out Donatelli's and other local businesses in Pittsburgh's Little Italy neighborhood!  Ciao!! Breakfast, breakfast, breakfast!!!  I've been here many times over the years 90% of which I've ordered breakfast.  Diner breakfast easily excites me and this place hits the spot!!  Home fries over hash browns and if my bacon bends and not breaks, then you can get  from me!  I don't think I've ever had a bad experience here.  I love it here any time of day from early a.m. when the seniors are here to after hours when the drunks are here lol. Thanks for many delicious meals, Ritters, and hopefully more to come :)", "user_id": "a0ULPTNi05w-BNVovVUz2w", "business_id": "mVHrayjG3uZ_RLHkLj-AMg"}
{"text": "I've been trying to find new and different restaurants recently, and this is one I found:\n\nAbout the place:\n- It's small\n- It's packed and crowded.\n- Due it's size, they seats near the walls are all awkward and can't be comfortable.\n- I wouldn't recommend it for big parties unless you organized it with the place ahead of time.\n- There is free parking outside, but you are going to have trouble finding a space\n\nThe food:\n- NOTHING COMES WITH THE HOT DOGS AND MEALS COME WITH CHIPS. The fries cost more to get as a side. Who ever heard of fries with your burger/dog? Um, apparently everyone except this place.\n- I got the chili cheese dog, the mac and cheese dog and the chili cheese fries.\n- The chili cheese fries are very very good and are some of the best I've had. If you like long fries with breading, you'll like these. The large size is indeed a large size and is enough for 2-3 people.\n- You get one hot dog, and with toppings on it, it will cost $6.50. I get two dogs with toppings at the local Sunoco for $2.22. I could also buy two packs of hot dogs and probably buns from a cheap place for $6.50, so it's not the cheapest.\n- The hot dog buns are good and have some green or black seeds on it. The hot dogs are just typical size and aren't super fat or foot longs.\n\nThe staff:\n- They are overworked but they are nice.\n- One of the girls was cooking and had no hair cover, so I could easily see hair going in food. Hope they fix that.\n\nSuggestions for D's:\n- Please sell curly fries or pretzels!\n- Stop being cheap. Give fries with your burger/dog and GIVE ME A SIDE WITH MY DOG.\n- Try to get a bigger place\n- Lower the prices for hot dogs or give two hot dogs. They have to be making near $6 profit on a $6.50 dog.\n\nWould I go back? Definitely. Ritter's Diner Menu - http://imgur.com/a/ISC7b\n(They don't have a website or a menu online, so I uploaded one on imgur).\n\nI just went to Ritter's, if for nothing else than to put a menu online for everyone to see. Yeah, that place is that old and that outdated.\n\nMy Order : Eggs/Sausage/Potatoes/Toast, Fried Chicken and French Fries and finally, Chili Cheese Fries.\n\nThe good:\n- They have parking, though their lot is a bit odd. No parking = no visit from me.\n- The eggs were pretty good. Can't say anything bad about them and they were some of the better eggs I had. \n- The potatoes/home fries were also pretty good. \n- I really like the consistency of their french fries. Their fries are long and taste good.\n- The breakfast prices are reasonable.\n- They do have a wide variety of options on their menu. They have seafood, burgers, hot dogs, chicken, steak, breakfast food, ice cream and other stuff.\n\nThe bad:\n- It's 2015 and they have no website or menu. Think about that. I have no idea how they could ever find customers not from the local area. They could put up a website for free and a menu as well. It would take less than 1 day of their time. There's restaurants from third world countries that have menu's online.\n- They want $1.75 for cheese on their eggs. I can almost buy a full pack of cheese for that price\n- The fried chicken is so so, but they want $7.70ish for one chicken wing sized leg, a mostly small breast and an even smaller leg. Not worth it at all, since you can get a better deal at Popeye's or KFC, who I both find expensive. Their chicken is better too.\n\nMy friend got an omelet of some sort and seemed to really like it.\n\nWould I return there? I could see myself returning for a quick breakfast once in a while, but I don't see myself going there for dinner.\n\nRecommendation: I can't say I recommend you going out of your way for this place. There's really nothing special about it, but they do have a wide variety of options on their menu, parking and the breakfast prices are reasonable. It's no Peppermill(a chain of diner restaurants in the west that are fabulous) though.", "user_id": "6ptKeJ-B8epsojFP47Gmng", "business_id": "2X5G4Ujq0s4Wfn4TC7gX0g"}
{"text": "The beer selection is large the food is pretty good too.  The wait staff is friendly the atmosphere is good... The patrons can be miserable human beings. \n\nI come here sometimes for trivia on wedensday nights. They have 3 dollar mystery beers, it could be delirium ( highly doubtful) or it could be pbr. But over 20 beers on tap pretty much all craft beers. Reasonably priced beer and food. This review is for the restaurant only, not the grocery store or the taco stand\n\nIf you want authentic Mexican food this is the place to get it in Pittsburgh.  Many people in pittsburgh think, Chiptole or Emilianos are Mexican... they are not those are TEX-MEX places... this is the same food you will find in Mexico and its delicious.  I have had many things here and i have always left happy. The waitstaff is very nice and attentive, from the person who greets you at the door to the waitstaff everyone is always smiling. \n\nThe food comes out extremely fast and they have great lunch specials.  \n\nThey have an outdoor patio, but i always go downstairs, its nice and cozy and doesn't feel like ur in a basement... even though it essentially is.\n\nIf you have never been you are missing out, so give it a try. I used to come here all the time for lunch when i worked in the area, and still come down every once in a while\n\nFirst the sushi...Andy's offers standard rolls for about $5-6 and special rolls for a few dollars more.  Its quite big for a roll and he likes to incorporate a lot of non traditional flavors, like mango, various fried things, and several types of sauces.   Does the sushi sometimes fall apart.. yes but the taste is pretty good for the price.\n\nWhere it kind of falls apart for me is everything else.\n\nFirst his stall is located right next to the door so if any sort of line forms you are constantly being bumped into by people walking in or asked to move by workers restocking the crab... Also its in a fish market so there is an overpowering smell of fish at all times\n\nThe next downfall is the overall cleanliness.  I would imagine that a lot of kitchens look a bit dirty, but they are usually hidden.  If you have a stall where you can see every inch, keeping it pristine should be a priority. \n\nThe last issue I had maybe just me being miserable at work.  That being said sometimes I just wanted to get sushi without the Andy show, chit-chat, and questions.  I get it, its part of the \"experience\" and most people that have been there once or twice will likely disagree, but sometimes its just a bit much, especially if u went as much as i did and realized its the same skit over and over again.  Would I mind if i was having a leisurely stroll, no, but if ur coming on your lunch break sometimes silence is golden.\n\nOverall though I would recommend it! I have only really been here late night so keep that in mind\n\nRitters is located within walking distance of the bars in Shadyside and Bloomfield and unfortunately it's the only place open  at 3am. As such I have been here more times than I would ever want to...\n\nIf I were blackout drunk cooking on a George foreman grill I could make better food...\n\nIf you like your eggs served in a puddle of miscellaneous  kitchen liquid, or bite into a chicken parm sandwich and have the breading slip off of the entire piece of chicken this is your place!!!\n\nThough I could list the horror stories I have experienced I will concentrate on one that summarizes this diner.... \n\nFriend orders a milkshake... Only gets the glass and not the residual leftover in the mixing metal cup... He drinks it rather quickly and wonders if the leftover will ever come... So he waits and waits keeps looking at the counter where the leftover bit is just sitting there...\n45 minutes later waitress finally walks over to it, drops a little bit of icecream in it mixes it... Puts it into a glass and serves it to someone else.\n\nWe called it the circle of milkshake life...in that every milkshake is half old half new.\n\nPeople keep coming back perhaps because they like the little nickel jukeboxes or because nothing else is open , I have even heard it being called a Pittsburgh culinary institution... I'm sure the brothers primanti, Pamela, and the delucas  are rolling over in their graves... If they are Infact dead.\n\nWhat's sad that though I am downright disgusted with this place at times,I know that I will return one drunken night ...

{"text": "I've gotten pick-up orders from here many times. It's standard Americanized Chinese food that hits the spot whenever I'm driving by and get a craving. The food is promptly made (about 10 minutes after I call in my order) and the vegetables taste fresh. I'm a big fan of their crab rangoons; there's lots of filling in them compared to the rangoons from other places. The sauce and meat in my meals isn't as flavorful as other Chinese take-outs have been, but it's still tasty. And my experience with the staff has been fine. Also FYI, it's cash only, and there's an ATM right outside by the door. I've never eaten in (there's a few tables) or in the buffet that's attached next door, so I can't speak on that. But overall, if you're getting a craving for some inexpensive Chinese and you're in the area, might as well give it a try. I love this place and order from them very often. It's typical Americanized Chinese food but the food is very tasty and made promptly. I love the chicken and broccoli, shrimp egg rolls, steamed dumplings, and crab rangoon, in particular. I never eat in (there's a few tables), so I always pick up or get delivery. For pick up, my order is made quickly after I call; for delivery, it takes 45-60 mins. They have never once messed up on my order. Definitely check out this place if you're looking for some delicious Chinese take out. This is a nice spot for Vietnamese food. It's not the best in Pittsburgh, but it offers a good portion of pho with great flavor. The vegetables taste fresh, too. I especially like the fried shrimp spring roll. The wrapping is crisp and light, and the filling is delicious. I'm not a fan of the fried pork spring roll though; the meat was dry and lacked any strong flavor. The restaurant itself is small and intimate; I like eating in because it's pretty quiet and the service is attentive and nice. I've also ordered pick-up a few times without any issues. Overall, I definitely recommend giving this place a try. FYI, it's cash only. Ritter's is a typical old-fashioned diner. It's cash only with an ATM inside. There's a parking lot which is convenient. Overall, my experience eating here has been inconsistent. Sometimes the food is good; sometimes I could barely eat it. Sometimes the servers are attentive and very friendly; sometimes they have a terrible attitude. I've had delicious meals, such as the breakfast items, sandwich melts, and honey-dipped fried chicken. And while breakfast is usually solid, lunch and dinner varies.\n\nFor example, my most recent trip here (a few days ago) was dismal. My friend ordered pierogis like he always does because they are usually very very good, but this time we sent it back for some butter because it was bone dry. When it was brought back, there was a small hair in it. I ordered a grilled chicken salad; it's hard to screw up a salad but Ritter's managed to do so. Yes, the portion was huge, but I found yet another hair in it and there was a pool of water at the bottom of the bowl. \n\nMy tip is to order breakfast foods because they don't mess that up and it's good. Going in during the day seems to bring about better service and food.\n\nEven though eating here is a hit or miss, I have a feeling I'll be back to try my luck.

{"text": "I like lunching at Casbah. The cheese tasting and tomato basil bisque are so good. If I could have them every day I'd be thrilled. One of the things I miss since moving to Bloomfield from Regent Square is being within walking distance to the Co-Op. It's the perfect neighborhood market and though on the smaller side they carry just about anything you need. Love the food bar and freshly made beverages. All natural all good. Sunday brunch is such a great deal and so filling. Some people don't like the potato pancakes but to me they're fab. Highly recommend. Beto's---I love you!! You had me at raw toppings! I'm one for extra cheese on everything. The cheese on this pizza is so generous that extra is never needed. I've been a patron since I was a kid. Primo pizza. Thank you for existing!! When I still lived in Regent Square it was a regular spot. I still go back now and again. It's nice because there's a mix of people there at any given time. Families with small children, couples on dates, groups of friends. All different ages. French fries and hot dogs are staples. Chicago dog is what I usually get. Nice beer selection. It can get really busy and the staff is always on their game. I live in the neighborhood and love to patron local establishments. However, Dunning's doesn't impress me. Kind of reminds me of an old timer, stuffy bar/restaurant. The food is ok. Typical and kind of boring. I think the prices are on the higher end for what they serve. I don't like seafood. At all. But I like this Pittsburgh landmark. I've been going for years. Why would someone who doesn't eat fish do this? I'll tell you why, because I love the chicken tenders and fries!! Yes just like a kid, I love them. There's nothing unique or fancy about this meal but something about the way it's cooked up makes it delicious. Maybe it's the pride the employees seem to take in what I call job well done. Can't go to Market Square without stopping in. Another perk living in Bloomfield...Angelo's! The pizza is good but the hoagies are even better. I can't believe how filling the sandwiches are. Half hoagie is dinner and lunch the next day. However, I have eaten the entire half in one sitting because I just couldn't stop myself. My faves are the steak and Italian hoagies. The epitome of a neighborhood dive. Smokey, sometimes loud, good jukebox, lots of drinkers. But you know what? I love my neighborhood and I love walking in and seeing familiar faces. Prices are fair and the bartenders are cool---they're great to talk to and look out for patrons. Seriously can't beat an ice cold pitcher of PBR when you're low on funds. At the higher end of the dive bar world you have Nico's. I say higher end because it's not as dank as most. It's older but has so much character (and I'm not just referring to the patrons). It's a neighborhood joint with stand up comedy and karaoke. Good food. The gyros are as good as any you'd get at a Greek restaurant. Nice little bar. The crowd ranges from millennials and hipsters to old timers and bikers. Eclectic mix of people. Another Pittsburgh institution. Definitely a go-to place on the weekend. Wee hours of the morning after a night at the club when you need cheese fries, pierogis or a giant omelette to get you to sleep. It's like taking a step back in time with the table side jukeboxes in every booth, decor and staff attire. I can only imagine what the staff have had to put up with over the years. So many drunks, so little time. Lol.

The food is pretty good, not the best Italian I've had, but not the worst (ah-hem Dels).  The Gnocchi is home made, which is great, and it is pretty good, but I'm not wild about the sauce.  The pizza is solid, yet can be inconsistent.  The pizza is thin (which I love, the way pizza is supposed to be), right amount of cheese, not to much, not to little, and usually (this is where the inconsistency comes into play) the sauce is right on.  \n\nThe atmosphere is, well, there really isn't any.  There usually isn't that many people there, no music, typically bad tv is on,  The bar is really old and really cool looking. \n\nI frequent here, because it is literally a 2 minute walk from my house.  I would certainly recommend it, but probably not as a first choice. I live off of Liberty Ave and everyone kept telling me I needed to try this place, so after 4 months I did.  When my wife and I walked in I thought, this place doesn't look too bad, actually kinda cool.  WRONG!  After being seated it probably took 5 minutes for the waitress to come over and another 5 minutes for our coffee to get to the table.  Our food took about 45 minutes, which is absolutely ridiculous for standard breakfast, but I though, everyone thinks this place is great, I guess I can wait for perfection. \n\nThe food gets to our table, it looks good, it looks like breakfast, but it is cold, well mine was cold.  So I'm sitting at the table, empty coffee, cold breakfast and quite pissed off, because of the situation and I'm hungry.  Finally after about 10-12 minutes the waitress comes by and asks how everything is, I tell her my food is cold, and I'm fine and don't need another plate, we had already been there over an hour, we had placed to go, ya know.\n\nWhen the waitress brings the bill over she doesn't just tell me she took my food off, she says, I figured I would take the food off even though you didn't ask (really?  should I have to?).\n\nWife's food was hot, but she thought it to be just average breakfast.\n\nI never want to go back, but I will, because I always give places another shot.\n\nTerribly slow service (server was very nice though, probably home from college), and food took forever.  I doubt this place puts out cold food on a regular basis, because this place wouldn't be so packed and highly regarded. I moved to Bloomfield in April and being Italian and loving Italian food I thought that Little Italy would be a good fit, I was wrong... Until tonight.  I have found that every Italian restaurant I've tried has left much to be desired; from Del's atrocious food to the over hyped Pleasure Bar, I had not found an Italian joint I liked.\n\nLombardozzi, I have not clue why I had not tried you until tonight.  I had tried their meatballs during Little Italy Days and really enjoyed them, but always forgot to head down the block to try a whole meal.\n\nWe started with calamari and it was fried t to perfection, and no rubbery feel, which is a positive, because 99% of places outside the east coast can't to calamari to save their lives.\n\nI had the gnocchi with red sauce (only sauce option which kind of irks me, because gnocchi is great with a pesto) with meatballs.  The gnocchi is homemade and to die for, and the sauce is pretty good too (I'm a sauce snob, nobody beats my mothers or grandmothers) and the meatballs were as good as I remembered.\n\nGreat food experience, but the service was at best bad.  The waitress took over five minutes to get our drink order, and just kind of seemed annoyed at the whole working thing.\n\nI will be back, because there is no Italian food in Bloomfield that even comes close to Lombardozzi.", "user_id": "rtpSmWb88ZLxVbRJISEa8Q", "business_id": "nUISXnW2Jo9ovnoFBIUY_Q"}
{"text": "I am not a big fan of seafood so it takes a lot to win me over.\n\nI tried several of the dishes at Original Fish Market including the lobster bisque, the halibut, and the pork-chop with coleslaw.

Furthermore, it took forever just to get our waitress's attention.  When we finally got her to look our way, she was short with us.  It was as if we bothered her.  I would rather go get sushi than spend more money here. I wanted \"authentic Pittsburgh food\" so I was taken here.  I have been spoiled by non-smoking restaurants for most of my life, so when I was taken to a Primanti-smoking-location and had to eat ASH with my food...I was already an unhappy camper.\n\nThe sandwiches were a novel idea adding both coleslaw and fries.

The fries were average but the coleslaw  in the sandwich was crunchy and delicious.  If the meat was more tasty, I'm sure I would've given Primanti 4 stars. Update.  Went to a different location.  Non-smoking location.  Got pastrami this time instead of the bland sausage.  Added a fried egg to the sandwich as well.  I forgot how huge this thing was.  I could only eat half.  I am now a fan of Primanti's. What do you want an Italian Restaurant to be?\n\nCheesy.  Saucey.  Greasy.  Tastey.  That is what describes my party's mozzarella sticks, jalapeno poppers, onion rings, fries and my Steak Calzone.\n\nI was taken here during my lunch break from work and I was not disappointed.  There were more than enough workers to compensate for the lunch rush.  The food was prepared fresh and fast.  The prices were cheap and fair.  The portions were huge and caused a nice food coma during my business trip to \"PGH.\"  Thus, I would recommend going here on Thursday or Friday lunches..because everyone knows...no work gets done Thursday and Friday afternoon anyways q=). Peppi's did not leave me peppy.  The wait for a cheesteak sandwich was just too long.  I came here after the lunch rush and still waited around 20-25 minutes.\n\nThe sandwich was o.k.  I got the steak special which includes, beef, cheese, onions, peppers, lettuce, and mayo.  The meat comes frozen in a rectangled thin patty.  It is fried, then chopped up, and ingredients added.  Half of my fries were burnt and the other half was soggy.\n\nThe restaurant is a typical dive and has many Pittsburgh Steelers paraphernalia. Being a Korean-BBQ lover and snob..I needed to get my Bulgogi/gal-bi fix when I was in Pittsburgh.  My search led me to Sushi-Kim.\n\nOh how I wish it led me astray.  This was probably one of the worst tasting Korean Barbecue places I have ever been to.  The beef was not the right color and was basically bland.  The beef short-ribs were tasty but was way too tough.  I felt like I had to chew each piece 100x or I was going to choke and die.  \n\nI was not a fan of the food at all and would not recommend it to anyone. My friend brought me here right when my plane landed in Pittsburgh, PA.  It looked as if was located deep in the heart of Pittsburgh.  We walked through a dark alley (skurry), where we parked, into this nice little restaurant.\n\nThe building itself looked old but cozy.  Maybe a little too cozy as our seats were rather cramped.\n\nAlthough known to be the best burger in the 'burgh (alliteration ftw), I went with the steak sandwich because I was on company money.  But it was just a piece of steak on a piece of rye bread.  The steak nor the fries were that memorable, but were filling.\n\nThe service was good and homely.", "user_id": "ZnOdDbndR0b5p6eF-014vA", "business_id": "z4cCguoHdU48pj6sXMIzqg"}
{"text": "Walking into Jimmy Tsang's was like walking into the Chinese restaurant that was on Hawaii Five-0 - it puts you back in time to the 1960's and the food is reminiscent of that era also.\n\nHot & Sour soup was highly americanized, not very hot or very sour.\nWonton Soup was a very large portion and good.\n\nEgg Rolls were large, slightly greasy but the filling was flavorless, not very good.\nCheese wonton's were okay but the old grease used to fry them in over-powered the flavor.\nChinese Flank steak was tough and chewy in a soy style sauce thickened with cornstarch, a little too salty and greasy but overall it was good.\nFlaming chicken was chicken breast with sugar peas, bamboo shoots and baby corn in a white/clear cornstarch chicken base sauce, that lacked much of any flavor except slat - it was just okay.\n\nTea tasted like American Lipton brewed in large quantities in the back than served in a generic tea-pot.\n\nThe place was clean service was good, prices are very good, but the food was just average. Out of the Big Burrito group (not counting mad mex) this is probably the biggest disappoint of their chain. And this is just not a one time bad experience, I have been here three times and have been less than enthused with the food vs price/value.\n\nService has always been good and attentive I enjoy their wines and the selections but on almost every dish there is something is either wrongly out of place or I expected much better for the money I am paying. For example:\n\nSumac scallop Appetizer, cooked perfectly, but the tartness of the sumac was not there, the other thing is I can brown a scallop at home, in a restaurant I am looking for a perfectly cooked scallop that has a nice caramelized sear on it, almost crunchy top juicy center. Also why so stingy with the baba ghanoush, 1 tsp, come on, eggplant is that expensive.\n\nRisotto - Over cooked not even a little bit of toothiness to the grain, plus it was pretty devoid of flavor but seemed to have had the addition of cream and butter to make it creamy.\n\nDuck Entr\u00e9e, again duck was perfectly cooked, quince jus was nice, not overly sweet but the faro did not compliment the dish at all. I even had a dining companion taste the combination and asked if they like it and they said it didn't go.\n\nPasta entr\u00e9e with spinach, this could have been good, but spinach was not washed and had grit in it, this item was returned and a braised lamb dish was ordered in its place, the lamb was slightly undercooked (read just a little tough) and jus that went with it was very watery.\n\nIf this was some little bistro where I was paying $20-25 for dinner (no drinks) I wouldn't be so picky but some of my meals have been north of $40 and for that amount of money I expect a little more attention to detail. Wiener World - solid hot dogs , good, not great taste, ok buns, topping are plain.\n\nWW wins the hot dog and bun competition between Franktuary but Franktuary wins the topping contest hands down. Now if we could combine the dogs served here with the toppings at Franktuary  you would have  a 4 star hot-dog joint. I can understand why some people give this place 5 stars and some shrug their shoulders and say nothing special.\n\nThe burgers here are ground fresh by an in house butcher and the meat is good, not greasy and very juicy. IMHO, if you added some ground chuck you would get even better flavor but overall they have some of the best tasting burger meat out there.\n\nThey cook on a griddle that is heated by burning hard woods, an interesting concept but to be honest I could not taste any smokiness to the meat. Also, IMHO, grilled meat tastes better, but griddled meat is juicer.\n\nThe burgers are served on what appears to be a Portuguese style bun, rather plain tasting they add very little to the burger itself. Toppings are simple lettuce, tomato, onions, etc. Their goal is to highlight the meat and not cover it up with lots of toppings or sauces.\n\nOn the side I had the home-fries, which they suggested, and to be honest they were disgustingly gross. Overcooked lumps of potato and onions saturated in grease that not only looked bad but didn't taste very good either.\n\nI like the ambience of the local burger joint, but thought a burger for $ 9.00 was pretty spendy. Service was good.\n\nBottom Line:\n\nSome of the best meat that I've had in a burger, it was cooked perfectly and very juicy - skip those home fires (yuck).\n \nIf you are burger purist, enjoying a plain all American hamburger with nothing fancy you will love Tessaro's, if however, you like a more complicated burger with lots of dressings / sauces and complex toppings you will find Tessaro's lacking.\n\nSo why three stars? 1 off for the home fires and 1 off for not grilling the burger over that hardwood.", "user_id": "88eJe5ywmYrrM_IyPyx8kw", "business_id": "tvXTHj9V5sgRoeVJW_FiTg"}
{"text": "I always love a good diner.  Gab and Eat was just what we were looking for on a Saturday morning.  Good food.  Great people. Pittsburgh ambiance. \n\nThis place is obviously a beloved neighborhood gem.  I had french toast and bacon.  The french toast was made with the best Italian bread.  My fiance had what they called a 'mixed grill.\"  It consisted of eggs, peppers, onions and home made sausage.  Not something you would eat everyday, but he loved it!   They also had great coffee.  They actually ground up the beans in front of us.  Now that's fresh.\n\nWe want to return sometime for \"turkey day.\"  Apparently they made fresh turkey every Tuesday.  Now that sounds good!\n\nCan't wait to return. Let's put the food aside here for a moment.  Let's talk about customer service for a moment.  Earlier this week, I had the misfortune of dining at the Waterfront P.F. Changs.  It was bitter cold outside. Their food is usually good, so my husband and I ducked in to get a bite before we went to the movies.  We were seated and we quickly ordered because we wanted to make our show time.  I didn't notice it at first, but I soon realized that it was cold in the restaurant. I asked about the heat and I was told that there was no heat - that it had broken earlier that day.  I asked our server why they hadn't mentioned this when we came in.  Well, I already know the answer to that - we would have turned around a gone somewhere else.  Then the manager came over and apologized.  I mentioned to him that it might have been nice to be warned about the heat (as I sat there in my coat).  He seemed to agree with me, but still allowed at least another 20 people enter the restaurant without saying a word to them. Not one word. Oh, he did offer me some dessert. That's what they usually do when someone has f**ked up.  In this case it didn't matter.  I quickly ate and left to make my movie.  This is the second bad experience I've had at this particular location.  Last time I was there, the floor was pretty dirty which always makes me nervous.  What does the kitchen look like?  I'm not against P.F. Chang's because it is a chain I have gone to in other states and have always liked the food.  This location needs to get their act together. I have passed by this place a zillion times and never given it a second look.  I thought it might be a Red Lobster knock off.  Then I asked a friend if they had ever heard of it and they had, and liked it.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by how nice the ambiance was inside.  Very cozy.  Much more upscale than I had thought it would be.  The service was terrific.  Lots of things to choose from on the menu.  A bit pricier than I had imagined.  Most entrees were anywhere from $17 to $30.  But this is Pittsburgh and this is seafood.\n\nThat said, they started us off with really delicious sour dough bread.  Butter was soft which I like.  Our entrees came pretty quickly.  I had a seafood assortment of blackened talapia, grilled sea scallops and salmon cooked on a plank.  The scallops were just done, I like them cooked a little more.  Everything else was pretty good.\nMy beloved had the crab cakes and really enjoyed them.\n\nWe'll probably be back, but will order something different.   We liked it. Loved this place.  Wasn't sure what to expect.  My cousin told me that they had the best burger in Pittsburgh.  Well, Ria, you were right!   Done to perfection, exactly the way I asked for it.  Not only was the burger great, the potato salad with came with it was just wonderful.  I think  Tessaro's will be on our list of go to places from now on!", "user_id": "rGuk1S7MIU8M9ZE2mulVsg", "business_id": "b9WZJp5L1RZr4F1nxclOoQ"}
{"text": "Perfect for a quick lunch.\n\nI had a New York style cheese pizza that was amazing, even the crust was delicious. Easily one of the most simplistic, amazing pieces of pizza I've ever had. The Greco piece of pizza I had was also perfect. It was topped with spinach and feta cheese I believe.\n\n I was so full after man-handling my second piece of pizza I had to stop eating. But my friend had a half finished piece of Greco just sitting there on the table waiting for me to finish it. It was as if the pizza told me to pick it up and keep nibbling and nibbling . This resulted in some sort of religious full feeling. God himself wanted me to finish that piece of pizza, and I listened. Beto's Pizza is definitely my go-to pizza in Dormont, even though I have to hop in my car and drive down there. Trust me, the drive back always seems like it takes forever, because I feel so weighed down from their delicious pizza.\n\nBeto's is a little unorthodox when it comes to your traditional pie of pizza. First, they sell pizza by the square slice ( which isn't so unorthodox, I know) and second their pizza comes out with the cheese uncooked on top of the hot crust, along with any other toppings you might fancy. So, yes, you will eat your pizza with uncooked cheese on it. And yes, YOU WILL LIKE IT.\n\nBeto's breaks the holier-than-thou commandments of pizza with their methods of pizza production, and while indulging yourself with their pizza, it never felt so right.\nTry eating more than four pieces, I dare you. I've been to Cain's quite a few times, since I live right down the street.\n\n\nThe best times I have had at Cain's consist of myself going into the establishment with the predetermined mentality of spending way too much for drinks ( $7.00 for a Jameson and Ginger!!??) and already being three sheets to the wind. \n\nDon't get me wrong, if you like going to a place that mildly reminds me more of a mosh pit at times than an actual drinking establishment, you would love Cain's. Definitely, avoid going on the weekends.\n\nBut, I will admit that Cain's is an awesome place to post up at the bar, drink a few beers, and catch a Pen's game on one of their million TV's. \n\nBottom line : This place is not a place where you and your buds can go and get poopy drunk at. Cains is, at best, a bar where you stop during a bar crawl for a beer and a shot. \n\nNothing more, and nothing less. I gave up meat for lent. I literally went forty, 24 hour days without a single bite of meat.\nSo whenever Lent ended, I had one thought on my mind, and that thought was a Gourmet Burger cooked at a delightful medium-rare from Tessaro's.\n\nNot having meat for forty days and then having a Tessaro's Gourmet Burger is like dying and going to a meaty paradise, where one can eat burgers all day and all night and never ever feel full.\n\nMy first bite into my burger led me to consuming the whole burger in no less than 2 or 3 minutes. I couldn't help myself, I kept eating and eating and eating as fast as I could, because my body was deprived of meaty protein for so long.\n\nThe Gourmet Burger came with lettuce, tomato, bacon, and my choice of provolone cheese. You also have the choice of yellow mustard, dijon mustard, or spicy brown mustard. I went with Yellow mustard, and mayonnaise, of course. I lathered the bun up perfectly with mayo and mustard and licked my fingers after my burger disappeared into my belly.Their potato salad and cole slaw are top-notch as well, and go amazingly with your burger.\n\nTessaro's burgers are AMAZING. No doubt about it, the best burger I have ever had in my life is the Gourmet Burger from Tessaro's.", "user_id": "NDrS9sG1w9hfLDt5gAIGsA", "business_id": "lHP5STO7aomlEQixH8m1aA"}
{"text": "We have been wanting to try Legends of the North Shore for a long time and since we were right across the street yesterday, we seized the lunch opportunity. It was not what I expected at all. Tiny I expected because I'd seen it driving by many times. Diner-esque inside, completely unexpected. I knew they are BYOB but after eating lunch here, I can't imagine any scenario where I'd take more than a couple of beers with me. Not a place to linger over a bottle of wine. Tables on top of each other, cramped and kind of a low end divey diner, uh uh.\n\nI wanted the mussels for lunch but was told they were out of them. Not terribly disappointed because our server had just run through the lunch specials and one had caught my attention enough that I mentally considered changing my mind anyway. A fried zucchini plank sandwich with melted mozzarella and side of sauce. I do love a good zucchini plank and had never heard of anyone creating a sandwich out of them, so no hardship to change my order. \n\nThat was a greasy, good lunch sandwich....heavy on the greasy but, I've always loved some tasty 'fried deliciousness!'\n\nHubs had the sausage sandwich... good...but mine was the clear winner.\nStarter soups were homemade and tasty. Hubby had black bean and I had the chicken pastine, aka wedding soup. The broth rivaled my premium homemade Christmas chicken soup broth so no complaints on that. \n\nOverall: ambiance 1star, mine and hubby's sandwiches 3 stars, soup 4 stars. Average is a 3 - not rushing back but I'd clearly have lunch there again, if I'm across the street. I've lived in Pittsburgh for what feels like forever and in all of that time, I guess I've never been to the Strip District on a Monday. We didn't realize most of the restaurants are closed on Mondays. Tried Thin Man, closed. Luke Wholey's, closed. We read some less than appealing outdoor menus of a few spots and settled on Roland's Seafood Grill for lunch because they were open and had a sign out front raving about their signature warm Lobster Rolls for $14.99. Ok, we were game.\n\nWe've driven hours off the beaten path in Maine for amazing Lobster Rolls at Red's Eats, which sets the standard for what all lobster rolls should be. Massive amounts of fresh lobster piled on top of the bun and drawn butter to dip the excess mound of lobster in is a mouth watering delight! \n\nThat couldn't be farther from what you get served at Roland's. The bun was Mancini's, so good start. The lobster was an odd orange color that's not what fresh lobster looks like at all. Nothing was heaped over the bun at all, but honestly after tasting it that part was ok. Combination of a few fresher tasting pieces, some rubbery pieces, and some dry pieces that literally could have been any fish. I skipped the fries, which didn't look all that great on hubby's plate and there was the tiniest container of coleslaw ever as a side that was actually pretty good. Considering I skipped the fries, shouldn't the server have asked if I wanted extra coleslaw knowing it was going to be minuscule? \n\nThe upstairs patio was really nice overlooking Penn Ave. and I hear they have a decent happy hour with terrific specials on fresh oysters and beer at the bar. I may give this place another shot based on that but, never again on their lobster roll. To hear Pittsburghers speak of Tessaro's in Bloomfield or to read most Pittsburgh Best-Of lists one would expect to find the worlds best burger here. What you find instead is a decent, run of the mill, average burger. The meat is pretty good and certainly juicy but rather lacking in seasoning and the toppings don't do much for the overall experience. I've had burgers that are 4 or 5 star burgers, just not here.\n\nI was famished the last time I ate at Tessaro's and so was my husband. I'd just spent the entire day at Shadyside Hospital having a minor procedure and hadn't been able to eat since the night before. We didn't get to Tessaro's until 3pm and both of us would have literally eaten anything at that point. While I spent the day waiting, I'd read one of those infamous Best Burger in the Burgh lists online and had been daydreaming about a big juicy burger literally for hours & Tessaro's was right down the street.\n\nThe bacon bleu cheese burger was on special that day so we both jumped. Peculiar that they offer the bleu cheese wet or dry. Guessing the wet is bleu cheese dressing and I like my bleu cheese straight up, so easy decision. Side of coleslaw for me, fries for hubby. \n\nWe both remarked that we expected it to taste better than it did. The bleu cheese had no flavor, the bacon was barely noticeable and I had to add ketchup to it to get anything going on. At one point, I even put coleslaw on it to try and wake it up. \n\nAs mentioned, the meat itself was good but I'm sorry even the best burger needs seasoning and flavorful toppings. If the bacon and bleu cheese had been 1st rate, this would have been a completely different rating and experience.", "user_id": "HI7byNVBtzinyLl3UCvynA", "business_id": "q_BKmbdlYfQJroJVHfYMUQ"}
{"text": "According to Urbanspoon (blasphemy I know) their are like 1,100 pizza places in pittsburgh. So what is the best pizza in Pittsburgh. Everyone has an opinion and so here is mine: The best pizza in Pittsburgh is the pie comes from the place in you neighborhood that has quality ingredients, fair prices, and friendly service. Eddie's Pizza Place  is all of these things and since I live in this neighborhood this is my favorite. Best coffee it Pittsburgh? Maybe, but this place is certainly competitive. French Press, Drip, espresso, or pour over? You name it they've got it. Only downside of this place is a limited food and pastry selection. If it is just coffee you want you this is the place. It is it a bit snobbish sure, but not nearly as much as many of the other coffee shops in Pittsburgh. German food and German beer served in a mason jar. Best in Pittsburgh. The history of the tavern and the friendly makes this wish me that I lived closer to Max's. If I lived in the South Hills I would come here all the time. I am not even sure how the pizza place across the street stays in business. I suspect that after the locals are done getting hammered off of Bado's awesome beer selection they need to order some crap when homebase has closed. Or it is a front for the mob. Easily my wife's favorite tacos in Pittsburgh. Pick your meat and then it is filled to the brim with lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and cheese. I kind wish they let me fill my own tacos, but it isn't really practical since they generally have a line on the weekends. \n\nThe grocery has the best tortillas, tamales, and salsa in town. I bought the jumbo container of their taco seasoning so I can imitate at home. It's Morton's... High end steakhouse with high end decor, service, and food quality. Nothing particularly amazing or different from this locations, but I did find the 3 course special to be a great value. Morton's was just purchased by Landry\"s which may lead to even more corporate feel. I could tell (because our waiter told us) that most of the staff is not exactly thrilled about the acquisition. We will see... Listen, Pittsburgh is not a sushi Mecca and never will be, but Andy has fair prices, fresh fish, and is easily the most charismatic sushi chef in the city. Cool environment and great sushi. What more do you need. Is Penn Fish better, maybe, but not as entertaining. It's just not that good. We initially told the waitress that we only going to order appetizers and desert. My code for \"we read on Yelp this place sucks, but we wanted to give it a try\" to which she replied they don't alow that but I will let it slide. The food could have come from a buffet and been better. I hate to be super negative, but in this case I am just being real. Good Indian food is tough to find. We ate their on a quiet weekday night. Service was friendly to the point that I though we might be friends. The portion sizes are big, food is well prepared, and over delivered on taste. I want to go back to give it a better review, but here is my experience. I called ahead and asked if they had highchairs. When we showed up they only had booster seats. 3 years ago I wouldn't have known the difference, but after spending 2 minutes watching my 1.5 year old thrash around I can tell you their is a big difference. The waitress made it seem as though it was my fault for bringing him. Yelp says good for kids they said we have a high chair. The waitress was about as warm and friendly as a night in spent sleeping in the snow naked. The potato salad was awesome everything else was super sub par. The burgers are big and if you looking for a giant patty of cheap meat then this is your place.

{"text": "First time here. My parents raved about this place and how great the spots are. \n\nWe arrived at 6:45 in a sat night and were promptly seated at our table.\n\nWe ordered an app and unfortunately this is where our problems began. They brought mussels instead of our mozzarella sticks. But this was quickly corrected. \n\nThey were fair. We had the Brussel sprouts which were under cooked and did not have any Parmesan cheese on them. Plus they were mixed in with large random pieces of lettuce. So odd! \n\nI was actually looking forward to the special. Ribeye topped with shrimp. But unfortunately they had already sold out of the special. Amazing since it was so early on in the night and nothing else in the menu looked good. It was all traditional oily foods. \n\nPlus who can't make a veal or chick parm. It's the easiest thing to make. \n\nMy parents had the spots and the portion was sooooo small and came on an plate all by itself. I give them a 1 for presentation. \n\nThe best part of the meal was the wine. Oh yeah it was byob. So I guess I did a good job at picking out the wine. Haha. \n\nService was nice and friendly. And she did apologize multiple times about the food. But did nothing to make up for it. \n\nWon't be back anytime soon. Great place for lunch. Excellent subs on amazing bread. Fresh, fast and healthy! \n\nBetter than any chain sub shop. \n\nHad the 6 inch torpedo. The battleship is huge!!!!!!! \n\nThey have an ATM inside and only take cash. Oldies are dying fast in the burgh. In order to keep up with the times, these classics just don't pass for the high end classy place to go anymore. \n\nI ordered the special which was a sea bass. My cousin ordered the same but her portion was easily double mine. Plus they have the worst presentation ever!!!!!! How can you send out just a piece of fish or steak on a plate. I get the whole family style but a small mini plate with my fish on it is just depressing. \n\nThink of it... If you own a restaurant what is your ultimate goal. Have the customer remember the meal, right? Well when someone serves me a tiny portion of fish for $38... There is nothing worth remembering but how lonely my fish was on the plate. \n\nOh yeah I had to eat my asparagus off a side plate. The asparagus was twice the size of the plate. Really....\n\nThe wife had a steak. The plate was 100 degrees and the oil was bubbling on the plate. They clearly used too much oil and did not let the meat rest. Cause when she was done the plate was a grosssssss oily bloody mess. \n\nThe severs need some basic training. Serve from the left and clear from the right!!!! Basics.... Come on. I expect these things from a high end place. \n\nNever going back! Ordered my usual Roberta salad. It's that hidden item on the menu that you have to know about. \n\nIt's a salad with rotini pasta that has been grilled. Broccoli and cauliflower and grilled onions and mushrooms. All topped with a steak or chicken. I usually go for a med rare steak. \n\nYou can get a small or large. My only complaint was that the veggies were too oily. I'll have to make sure to ask for steamed veggies with no oil. \n\nOther than that my wife had the exact same meal. \n\nService is always good and friendly.

{"text": "If you are here to just play games, then its a great deal of fun, and is also a fantastic place to catch a sporting event. \n\nIf you are here to eat, maybe try somewhere else. I have tried eating here on several occasions and find that it is for the most part terrible. Nothing tastes like it is fresh at all. I would guess everything is delivered frozen and then either deep fried or heated in a microwave. I can't think of any meal I've ever finished here either from being bland or just plain lousy. Even my 11 year old, who loves wings and chicken fingers (2 staples here) thinks the food is terrible and refuses to eat here, even though he loves to play the games. \n\nMy advice, eat somewhere else then head here to play. On the positive side, the delivery was pretty quick, given I ordered during the dinner rush, where I would consider under an hour to be pretty exceptional. After that, the food was pretty meh. The pizza wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. Given the relative quick delivery, it was on the cold side upon arrival. Also, I had ordered a fried pickle appetizer. It was clearly a frozen appetizer, so I knew what to expect, but this also arrived cold and soggy. All and all not a terribly positive experience given the vast wealth of take-out options in the area. Back in my coaching days at Chartiers Valley this was one of my goto places in Lebo. The pizza is good, one of the best reubens in town and friendly bar tenders. The beer selection is pretty good, not great but a good selection. A nice gem in Mt Lebo. Angelo's has by far and without question the best hoagies in town. In fact I'd be hard pressed to think of better I've had anywhere. Maybe it's the homemade dressing (a creamy mayo/Italian concoction they call mayonnaise), maybe it's the fresh meats and bread, maybe it's the way the name them is the pizza oven... I don't know. It's probably all the above. My favorites are the capicolla &  mushroom cheesesteak. \n\nThe pizza is also very very good, but the subs are so outstanding it's tough not to go with those. I also love the fresh made garlic knots. \n\nThe ambiance here is nothing special, but the food more than makes up for it. The only thing keeping me from a 5-star review is they don't do residential delivery. The hoagie is worth the walk, but someone else bringing it to me would just be perfect, especially if it's pizza I want them I'm probably being lazy. Love this quaint little Italian grocery in the heart of Bloomfield. I try to go at least once a week to pick up homemade pasta, tremendous anti-pasta, Italian meats and cheeses, fresh cannoli or just enjoy the wonderful smell when you walk in. Tessaro's is without a doubt the best burger in Pittsburgh. Everytime they are perfectly seasoned  and cooked to order. They are also huge, to the point I am full but have to finish anyways. One complaint is you can't get French fries, but the home fries are a great and different substitute. \n\nThe decor is rustic with plenty of wood booths and denim tablecloths. The staff is also very friendly and seems like they have been here as long as I have been coming here. The most amazing thing about this place is the kitchen. It us a tiny, and I mean tiny, open kitchen just behind the bar area. How they get such tremendous flavors from this kitchen is amazing but I can't complain. Also for as busy as they get, especially on weekends, they still get food out pretty quickly. \n\nI highly recommend coming here to anyone who enjoys a good burger.", "user_id": "NH8aEIKCSO_xtp54zrMoTg", "business_id": "sbW8qHJgzEIH42B0S-3New"}
{"text": "Ok, so I know this place is somewhat of an institution now because of their Food Network exposure, but I'm going to have to go against the grain here and say that I did not enjoy my Dor-Stop experience.\n\nWe came here many months ago after hearing all of the hype. I'd never been to Dormont before and we were eager to check out this place and the neighborhood in general (side bar: Dormont is adorable! If it were a bit more convenient to where we work and like to play, I would totally live there). \n\nAnyhow, so we get there on a Saturday morning, and the place is packed. No biggie, most good breakfast spots usually have a wait on a weekend morning. I think we waited about 30 mins, which wasn't bad. We're seated, we order, everything is just peachy. Then things started to go sour.\n\nIt had been about 40 minutes since we were seated and we still hadn't received our food. Other diners who were seated after us had received their food and were finishing up. Our waitress hadn't stopped by our table in a long time. I had started to wonder if maybe our ticket was lost (ordinarily I wouldn't think anything of it, but the fact that people seated after us had gotten their food made me think something might have been wrong). Anyway, so the next time we see our waitress walk by, we flag her down and ask her if she knew when our food would be out. We asked politely. We weren't snarky, we weren't mean, we didn't roll our eyes or snap our fingers. It was a simple question, one that I think many would probably ask. And the waitress replied, \"Are you really hungry or just really impatient?\" No hint of a smile on her face. No twinkle in her eyes. It was clear that she wasn't joking (not that it would have been funny anyway). \n\nHmm. Are we really hungry or really impatient? Well, neither...we just wanted to make sure our ticket hadn't gotten lost. We sat in stunned silence, unsure of how we should respond to such a flat-out rude remark. The waitress left, and finally brought our food out about 10 minutes later (and then we never saw her again except for when she dropped off the check). By that point, our appetites were pretty much gone, and we just wanted to leave. So we scarfed down our food and got the heck out of dodge.\n\nI dunno. Maybe the waitress was having a bad day. Maybe she gets asked that question a lot (by actual impatient people) and is sick of hearing it. But we were very polite to her and didn't deserve to be treated like that. I don't care how good your food is (and for the record, the food was okay, but certainly not mind blowing for the all the hype), if you have lousy customer service, I can't support you. And it's a shame, because I really, really wanted to like this place (it looks like such a cute mom and pop place). With so many other great breakfast spots in the Burgh, I'd rather go somewhere that cares about giving their customers a good (or at least not a blatantly bad) experience. Ah, Pleasure Bar. Yes, this place looks like it hasn't been updated for many decades. However, I find that kind of charming -- I imagine all of the steel workers of yore, boots dirty and hands ragged, gathering at the local watering hole after a long day's work to unwind with their neighbors and enjoy a cold pint and some good food.\n\nAnyway, I digress. I've been to the Pleasure Bar several times, and I have always left relatively satisfied. I've never encountered any service issues, and the food has always been decent. Now don't get me wrong -- the food isn't super modern, light, amazing Italian cuisine. It is, however, good \"Pittsburgh Italian\" --  and by that I mean that many of their dishes are heavier, richer, and more dense. Yes, I just made up the term \"Pittsburgh Italian\", but for a city that puts french fries on its salads, I think it fits. For example, one of their more popular and delicious appetizers is their potato balls -- as the name suggests, these are deep fried balls of mashed potatoes. Delightfully crispy on the outside, and warm, smooth and creamy on the inside. Their gnocchi is delicious, but very dense -- it's not the light, pillow-y type of gnocchi that some other Italian restaurants serve. That being said, I have no problem with starchy, dense gnocchi. I often get it tossed with mafalda sauce, which is one of their signature sauces that is a combination of marinara and alfredo. Sinful!!  So yeah, their food is the type of food that is rich and delicious, but you're definitely not going to be running a 5k after eating it (then again, running a 5k is overrated anyway ;) ) \n\nSo for what it is, I think Pleasure Bar's food is actually pretty good. However, the last three times that I've visited, I've had -- hmm, how to say this politely? -- \"intestinal issues.\"  The first time it happened, I thought maybe it was a fluke, but then I went again a few weeks later, and once again it was a gastrointestinal race to the finish home. I gave it one final try, but met the same fate.  So there is clearly something about their food that doesn't agree with me (and for the record, this doesn't ever happen anywhere else). To be fair though, it's very possible that my body is just weird, because in all cases my dining partners have not gotten ill.\n\nSo I'm kind of torn -- my brain wants to give Pleasure Bar 4 stars, maybe 4.5, because I really do like their food. But my GI tract wants to give them a 1 or a 2. So I'll split the difference and go with 3.", "user_id": "Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw"}
{"text": "I've never been crazy about the food here, but my friend likes it, so I do eat here once in a while. We stopped in last night and I had the chicken finger appetizer with fries. The food was a little overcooked and nearly tasteless. The ranch dressing was barely good enough to make up for it. \n\nMy friend had the mac & cheese with chicken and bacon, which is what she orders just about every time she's there. It looked delicious and the portion was huge. I'll be trying this dish next time we're there. \n\nWe've also had the Ball Park Pretzels in the past, and they're really good. \n\nI'm giving 4 stars because the service was great, there's outdoor seating, and the Berry Bash Sangria was delicious (if expensive). We'll be back. I don't expect much from fast food restaurants. But I do expect to be spoken to when I am a paying customer. I just went through the drive-thru at this location and, other than taking my order at the speaker, no one said a word to me. There was a different person at each window, and neither of them said hello, your total is, fuck you, nothing. I don't think I've ever encountered such a miserable bunch of people. \n\nMaybe they're upset because their heroin operation was shut down. I was here in January for my department's holiday dinner. We wanted to go in January when all of the Christmas chaos had settled down. But Tessaro's was surprisingly crowded for a Tuesday evening right after the holidays. However, the place was still fairly quiet and low key, and we only waited 5-10 mins for a table. \n\nThe 6 of us were seated in the booth in front of the kitchen, and it was pretty cozy. Most of us had burgers, and we all enjoyed our meals. I had some kind of bacon cheeseburger and it was rather delicious. The home fries were just ok, but only because I'm not crazy about home fries. Tessaro's doesn't have french fries on the menu, so home fries were my best bet. I think they also serve potato salad as a side, which I don't eat, so I didn't try any. But those who do like potato salad rave about Tessaro's. \n\nService was great, especially considering there were 6 of us and the place was crowded. Prices were moderate, from what I remember. \n\nOverall, it was a great experience and I'll be back. I've been making an effort to try more places in the city, and I had a chance to try Pleasure Bar last week. A friend of mine is a regular there and it came highly recommended. \n\nI have to be in the mood for Italian, but it was really good. Friend had the chicken noodle soup, which I had a taste of, and it was delicious. Ranch dressing is my default condiment, and theirs is to die for. I was dipping bread in ranch after I had finished my salad. Speaking of, the Italian bread was fresh and delicious. Even the butter was great, despite coming from those little containers with the peel off top. Then we had the potato balls. Come on, you can't go wrong with balls of fried potatoes and cheese. They were really good. I had chicken parm and couldn't believe the size of it. After bread, salad, and potato balls, I was only able to eat about 1/4 of it. While it was good, I thought that my friend's carbonara was better. That's what I'll be getting next time. \n\nI ordered stuffed shells with a meatball to take to my mom. She used to frequent Pleasure Bar in her younger days and said the food is as good as it was back then. I also got her a slice of chocolate cake, which she loved, although it's more of a dark chocolate. \n\nService was great, but to be fair, it wasn't busy at 6pm on a week day. I agree that the decor is a little dated. It definitely has an Old Pittsburgh feel, which I don't mind at all. \n\nI'll be back the next time I'm in the mood for Italian!", "user_id": "qZbgGiWIi52GL7o3ot5ckw", "business_id": "McikHxxEqZ2X0joaRNKlaw"}
{"text": "Love the fish sandwiches, they are all they are cracked up to be.  If you want lunch - try a sandwich here - but order ahead for pick up, or be prepared to wait 30 minutes or more in a shady looking bar.  The bar is very smoky, although it is also stocked with a soda machine if you get thirsty waiting for your sandwich to be made.   Although for a fish sandwich and fries you'll probably drop about $10, I think its definitely worth it. Nico's was a place I heard I should visit, but I was always a little scared to go inside.  The outside is typical dive bar with block windows and no way to actually see inside.  Once you're inside though, it is a different story.  There is a huge bar area (filled with yinzers talking about the Steelers), and past that there is a decently sized sit down area with booths and tables.  Nothing fancy here, but good and attentive wait staff, and nice cheap beer, sports tv, and quick yummy food.  There was a large group of us, and we ordered the Greek Platter, and it was just right.  Everything from fresh feta and olives to spanakopita and grape leaves.  Nico's is on Friendship Ave and very close to the hospital (hence the 'recovery room').  I look forward to checking out the Saturday Karaoke to see what Pittsburgh local vocals will produce. I do have a special place in my stomach for Tram's kitchen and I try to eat there every now and again.  Pho is a good meal to warm you up in the winter and this place is a great place to stop in for a yummy dinner.  I have been a little wary to go off the beaten path of the spring rolls and the Pho, so I got the spring rolls and the chicken peanut soup (I think that is what it was called).  It was very close to the chicken Pho, except it had less noodles, more veggies, and a little different twist on the sauce with some crunched peanuts that settled at the bottom and a bit more spice.  The dishes definitely didn't disappoint.  The parking is on the street (which is usually pretty empty after working hours), and the ambiance seems to have perked up a little bit with what I think is a new coat of baby blue paint and some new flowery table cloths.  Don't worry though, the mother of pearl wall art is still there, and your chances of not understanding your server is still high.  The prices are cheap, the grub is good, and the place is uh... rustic, oh yeah, and bring cash! I'm going to have to completely agree with Jessica M.'s review of Silky's.  It is the closest bar to my house so I check it out whenever I can.  It is as close as I can define a \"Sports Pub\", with the tvs showing sports, but with the British Pub decor, and not spilling over the brim with sports fans.  They have good solid pub food which is tasty and with big portions.  The food is always above par and I don't ever think I've had something I wouldn't order again.  I even got a grilled cheese and loved it!!  There is a bit of sticker shock, when you see a sandwich for around 8 bucks, but the sides and the taste make up the difference.  They have some good beers on tap, and you can spend a pretty penny, or you can get a pitcher of Yeungling pretty cheap and just  hang out and play shuffleboard if you like.  The atmosphere is good and friendly, and they have tables outside in the summer.  The jukebox does leave many songs to question, but overall it is a good mix.  There is only street parking, but you usually don't have to walk far.  I'm glad this is my neighborhood pub, and I'll be back, so glad it's gone smoke free!", "user_id": "bU8oW3KjhH4OmCbW1z4xUA", "business_id": "FD6OocZdFUfE2J5H0WN4fA"}
{"text": "Completely agree with Deborah: decent sandwich on absolutely horrible bread - mealy tomato and brown lettuce, too.  I know it was only $4/$7 for a 6\"/12\" sub, but it was pretty bad.  (I bought a 12\", intending to take half home for later, but I wound up throwing the second half away, and I NEVER throw away food.)  \n\nAs a Italian grocery, it seems okay, but the attitudes are a little snippy, and it's a pretty grungy-looking place. Awesome tortillas, awesome salsa, pretty good selection of Latin American food products (mostly Mexican, but lots of S./Central American and Caribbean).  I'm spoiled from all the Hispanic grocery stores in Atlanta, but this is the best one I've found in the 'burgh.  Prices are average for the Strip and Pittsburgh, but a little high for a Hispanic grocery store. Just discovered their taco stand outside a few weeks ago.  WOOHOO!  Like the stuff on the inside, they charge just a bit too much (street tacos should be $2 max, not their $3/2 for $5), but they're excellent.  They even have lengua (tongue - tasty).  I haven't seen that since Buford Highway in Atlanta.  Probably not the best if you're from San Antonio or San Diego, but the best you'll find within 200 miles. Great place to get a drink on the deck and watch the river traffic, but that's the only good point of the place.  Food's okay - nothing to write home about; service is pretty average and a bit unfriendly; decor is a little too \"tacky nautical\".  Prices are pretty average, but too high for the quality and service levels. Uggh.  I wanted pho really bad, but theirs tastes like warm ramen broth with 4 little pieces of meat in it.  Got the fried spring rolls, too, and they charged $5-6 for four little rolls that were obviously prepackaged frozen spring rolls.\n\nI gotta stop trying out restaurants without checking Yelp first, because everyone else is dead on.  Avoid this place unless you're in the Strip and absolutely have to have some Vietnamese (and don't care too much about quality). Best pho I've had in ten years.  I want to try something else at Tram's, but I can't help but order pho every time I'm in there.  I agree with other reviewers: they could definitely add slightly more \"fixin's\" for the pho (can you tell I'm Southern?), and the fixin's could be a little fresher, but the pho itself is excellent.  The spring rolls are excellent, too.  I just wish they served 33 beer to go with it all.  \n\nService is good, if a bit gruff.  Don't screw around chit-chatting at the table when you come in; you need to be ready to order when the waiter (Tram?) gets to you.  Failure to do so will expose you to his withering scorn.  (Seriously, he'll hang out, staring at you, until you make up your mind.)  \n\nPrice is right, too.  With spring rolls and an entree, you'll get out of here for under $10/person. Huge burger and good service, but the burger's more than a little bland.  It's cooked over a wood-heated griddle, which sounds cute, but the griddle means that it doesn't pick up much, if any, flavor from the wood fire.  (Might as well be cooked over gas or an electric griddle.)  Throw in some chuck or pork fat or spices or garlic or something with some flavor and it would be much better, too.  That they butcher it in the back and the nice service takes them up from 3 to 4 stars. Pretty good sports bar.  I didn't have any food, but they've got a decent beer selection, and prices and specials are pretty good.  They've got plenty of screens to watch your favorite event(s), and the outdoor seating on the sidewalk is good, too, if you want to escape the sports crowd but still enjoy some of the atmosphere.", "user_id": "go2dZIDfrEBqfsGKnA4m7g", "business_id": "imzKM9-mgN1Yk_RIXx3IgA"}
{"text": "Ladies and Gentleman, welcome to pancake heaven. It was several years ago that I first came upon The Dor-Stop, and since then my breakfast lifestyle has been forever changed.\n\nI know this will sound like blasphemy coming from a Dor-Stop convert, but I hate pancakes. I just don't understand them, they are odd and moist, and nowhere near as delicious as waffles. I came into The Dor-Stop the first time with this mindset, and am now forever changed. \n\nThe Dor-Stop's hotcakes are delicious and almost cake-like. They aren't thin crepes, or undercooked globs of batter, but instead sweet, fluffy treats that come in a plethora of flavors. I personally endorse oatmeal walnut, but others love the banana or pumpkin (when in season). I recommend ordering the \"Egg Combo\": 2 hot cakes, eggs, and bacon/sausage. Go all out, you deserve it. \n\nOn a recent visit, I also discovered the french toast menu, which has caused me to forsake my hot cake habit. The french toast is almost deep fried and covered in this raspberry yogurt. It is a can't miss item on the menu, rivaling that of the hot cake. When pumpkin french toast is a special on the menu, I suggest you run to The Dor-Stop and taste a little of heaven. \n\nI've also sampled various items from the lunch menu with no complaints. The Rachel and Ruben are especially tasty if you feel like bypassing the breakfast menu. \n\nThis place is truly heaven in Dor-Stop. Make sure you arrive early on a weekend morning to avoid the crowd! Or wake up at dawn on a weekday and partake (as I have been known to do from time to time!) The first time I walked into Tessaro's, I felt at home. It might be the inciting smell of meat wafting from the grill (home is where the meat is), or it's the way you feel welcome the second you walk through the door. \n\nTessaro's is a Pittsburgh legend, but I hadn't been there for the first time until about 6 month ago. The wood interior is cozy, and I've never seen the place anything but packed. That being said, it's never taken more than 10 minutes to be seated. \n\nI can't tell you about anything on the menu but the burgers. I can tell you though, the burgers are amazing. They come on massive buns with all the fixings, and a cup or mayo or mustard. While I dabble in the breakfast burger, I almost always get a standard cheese burger. It's consistently delicious. \n\nI think the one thing that ticks people off is that Tessaro's serves home fries instead of french fries. DO NOT BE DISCOURAGED--those sliced up potatoes are delicious, and in no way do I miss a plate full of freedom fries.  \n\nJudging by their lunch menu, Tessaro's has a decent sandwich game at lunch. I'll be the judge of that at a later time. Silky's is my go to spot for a laid-back Friday night where you can have a few drinks and play some shuffle board without a crazy crowd. The place is never empty, but it's also never too full where you can't get a table. The crowd is a mixed bag, but like many bars in Pittsburgh, I've never felt out of place there.\n\nSilky's has a slightly above average tap list that often includes Southern Tier, Fat Heads, or Great Lakes. I have been disappointed several times when the tap list has changed but not the menu. I get my heart set on a beer, only to find out the keg has been tapped. No complaints though, there is always something else to try. \n\nI haven't had much food here, but the waffles fries are a great candidate for a late night bite.\n\nSilky's has several dart boards, and a shuffle board table along the window. If you get here early enough, you can get in a few shuffle board games before someone else takes a turn. \n\nWhen the weather is nice, the patio is a great option. There's potential for good people watching on Liberty Ave most days. However, asthmatics be forewarned, the bar is non-smoking, but the patio is not.", "user_id": "gEuGe2By1e9G3ZKXuMGzrw", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw"}
{"text": "I don't understand the low reviews. This is a very well run neighborhood McDonald's where retired folks seem to gather over coffee in the morning. I have been here a few times and service was always prompt and courteous. The food is consistent with McDonald's everywhere and the restaurant clean.\n\nMy only complaint was free ATT WiFi was slow on my last visit. I don't have the opportunity to eat a lot of German food, but the Weisswurst platter I had here was quite excellent. Prices are moderate. Service was just awesome.\n\nThe menu is quite extensive, and I hear the beer is pretty good too. If I lived in Pittsburgh, I would be a regular. I assume lots of folks have seen this place featured on Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins, Dives. This place is exactly as it is on the show, really tasty breakfast foods all made from scratch. Great family atmosphere with friendly staff.\n\nI had the apple cinnamon hotcakes and the cheese steak hoagie sandwich. \n\nThe hotcakes were just awesome. They came as a stack of three hotcakes with a lump of butter and a squeeze bottle of syrup.\n\nThe hoagie was just average, kind of small with lettuce tomato, green pepper seasoned with salad dressing and mayo. Kind of weird.\n\nCoffee wasn't very tasty either, or rather seemed to be on the mild side.\n\nNote their hours are 6a - 3p. Metered street parking and a metered public lot down the block. My first visit to the chain in years. Not exactly fine dining but this was open until midnight on weekdays.\n\nI had roast beef sliders and a bowl of French onion soup. The sandwich buns were mushy otherwise everything was fairly good.\n\nService was very good. Meal clocked in around $15 with tip which I think is 3 or 4 too high. Much more extensive menu than Denny's along with a bar if you happen to need a late night fill up. Oh so good and huge! Each sandwich is both tasty and large enough to feed two normal folks for lunch.\n\nAt the suggestion of the server, I ordered the Kolbassi Sandwich. It came fast and was oh so good! Also free soda refills.\n\nService was good mid afternoon on a weekday, and I enjoyed the whole experience watching the NFL Hall of Fame induction ceremony on the flatscreens while eating. Went tonight for $4.99 rollback Wednesdays. Not very many people at around 9p, so service was really excellent.\n\nI only ordered the $4.99 spaghetti with meat sauce which comes with salad and bread. Even ignoring the price, I really enjoyed the whole meal from start to finish. I suspect true Italian aficionados will be upset that the pasta is cooked through, but it really reminded me of home growing up in the Midwest. Mushroom cheesesteak with a Stewart's root beer for lunch today. Freshly made, toasted bun, all good! Friendly service. Conveniently across the street from UPMC Shadyside hospital.  \n\nGreat service and down home atmosphere is hard to beat. Had the liver and onions which came with choice of potatoes, veggies, and a hard roll. Normal person portions and with a coffee came to less than ten bucks. \n\nFood wasn't anything to right home about, but a nice experience, convenient location, and open 24 hours. \n\nCash only, but there is an ATM machine. Good homestyle American fare. High quality ingredients, well prepared. Liked the new gourmet sides of loaded potatoes and Mediterranean green beans. I think the quarter dark plate with 2 sides is pretty good especially if you use one of the free soft drink or $1 coupons in the paper or from their website.\n\nService was good, and restaurant super clean when I went.

{"text": "Strawberry Walnut salad was excellent - tender chicken, fresh strawberries and mixed greens, and perfectly sweet candied walnuts with feta cheese sprinkled throughout! The roasted eggplant, spinach, and feta flatbread also tasted fresh, which surprised me considering the short wait of 5 minutes or so. The entire dish was layered with thick slices of tomato, and I liked actually being able to taste the eggplant. The pesto sauce was prominent without overpowering the other elements of the dish. Well worth the $12 Pick and Choose price IMO. I did find a curly, black, and fine strand of hair at the side of the salad plate, so a small star off for that.\n\nI had a coupon for a free dessert,  so I asked for the mini chocolate peanut butter cup. It was good but not memorable. I liked that there were mini chocolate chip with the peanut butter though. I'm not sure if the outer chocolate was intended to be rock hard or if the cold ice cream on it had simply hardened it, but it was extremely difficult to cut through with a mere spoon. For a free dessert, it satisfied me though. \n\nThe server, Christy B, was very friendly and attentive throughout the meal as well! Perhaps the crowd here is less harsh, because I feel like the location in Squirrel Hill has been consistently better despite having a slightly lower rating. I've only been here three times - twice on a Wednesday night around 5 and once on a Saturday at around noon. From looking at the other pictures, the food doesn't seem so bad, so I might have just been unlucky on the Wednesday evenings, because both times I've ordered, the food was completely unsatisfactory.\n\nThe first time, the sesame pork chop was tiny - definitely not worth nearly 10 dollars (I take SOME presentation into account as well, and the food just looked thrown together on the plate). But I had the great salad bar to make up for it, and managed to cram 6 plates of salad because I'm a college student trying to maximize my nutrient to price ratio. And on the plus side, the waiter, Kevin, was very friendly, and even comped my HUGE piece of pumpkin creme pie for no particular reason. I didn't mention anything about the pork chop because I was very satisfied with the salad bar, anyway.\n\nThe second time, I ordered the chicken broccoli alfredo, and it was absolutely disgusting. I could see oil droplets on the entire dish (and I understand that alfredo is a creamy, oily dish, but this was ridiculous), the chicken was slightly burnt, and there were THREE pieces of broccoli. In a dish called \"chicken and broccoli alfredo!\" Honestly, I've never sent back food because who knows how chefs would respond, but oh well. On the plus side, the waitress (Aly or Ally I think) was absolutely lovely. A lot of energy, smiles, and attentiveness, so of course, I tipped well.\n\nThe place was packed on Saturday at noon, but other than that I had no issues. I'm not sure who cuts the pies though (whether they're already sliced or the waiter/waitress does it quickly), because the carrot cake I had was considerably tinier than the pumpkin creme pie! Perhaps they'd anticipated not having enough? I base my stars on what type of restaurant/eatery it is. For Boston Market, I expected some sort of slightly more upscale fast food joint based on reviews from all sorts of places, but it went beyond my expectations. It's mostly catered toward takeout I suppose, so you order and pay in front of a counter that displays the actual side items and menus at the back, and then seat yourself.\nFirst of all, the cashier, Rachelle, was extremely friendly, so that was enjoyable! I ordered the market bowl and she accidentally gave me a cornbread but waved it off as free xD In any case, the turkey breast was wonderful - thick, juicy cubes covered with a flavorful beef gravy sauce. The steamed vegetables were well made - not mushy/overcooked - and although the mac and cheese was a bit too creamy for my tastes, it wasn't bad. The cornbread was a bit too crispy on the bottom and dry, but after a whole day of sitting under the heat lamp, it's not too surprising.\n\nSo I will be back!

{"text": "It's an odd place -- a former brothel that's reputed to be haunted, with a lot of dark polished wood decor. In all the times I've been there, it's never once been crowded. It's very noirish, even in the daytime; the sort of place you'd go to watch horse races -- desperately, of course, on which you'd just bet it all. And the guy at the other end of the bar hasn't been home in years, and the ominous bartender has a Dark Secret, and you'd better keep your damn beak out of it!\n\nExcept the bartenders here are actually quite warm, and not ominous at all. In fact, they're more than willing to learn your preferred arcane beverage recipes. One guy there, Frank, actually keeps a little book of new recipes he learns from customers, which I appreciated quite a bit. I also really enjoy the appetizers here, especially the flatbreads and the bruschetta, which are probably the least noirish foods imaginable.\n\nSo, ignore your instincts about this spooky-seeming place and check it out. The entrees are not terribly impressive, but it's a great stop for an evening with other plans in it. This place, in a word, rules. My wife and I went on Monday night, which happily turned out to be $4 house wine night! Chardonnays in hand, we perused the menu, which is quite the daunting task. They've got a wide array of stuff on there, and usually, that's kind of a flag for me. A lot of places that offer that wide a range of stuff tend to be...well, just okay at a lot of foods, not great at many.\n\nCafe Sam, though, was delicious across the board. Our calamari in General Tso sauce, our Ahi tuna skewers, the zesty housemade Buffalo chips, my gigantic, 12-ounce burger at a perfect medium rare, my wife's angel hair pasta with langostino...I was impressed by all.\n\nWe went late in the evening, so we missed the rush. The dining room was pretty much all ours, and we struck up some conversation with the manager, who was very friendly but not intrusive to our date night. She brought us samples of a couple different dishes, like their pigs in a blanket (a slice of all-beef frank with bell pepper relish, cheeses, wrapped in a toasted tortilla), the aforementioned Buffalo chips (served usually at the bar), and a yummy shot of mulled rum apple cider.\n\nThe service was excellent, the food even better -- and the dessert? Four words: Jager. Root Beer. Float. I hope whoever dreamed that up got a MacArthur grant, because they're a freaking genius.\n\nI should also note, the prices on everything were great -- you get a lot of bang for your buck. Without a doubt, I recommend.\n\nOh, and be sure to ask about the mannequin at the bar; it's a neat story! This is a friendly, hipsters-and-yinzers-living-in-harmony kind of joint. Sports on the TVs, Yeungling on tap--quintessential Pittsburgh. The fried fish (with fries and coleslaw) is Lenten-Catholic quality. If I minded cigarette smoke, this place would be a four; but since I don't, perfect score. Like Scorpion once intoned...\"Get over here!\" How on earth haven't I reviewed this place before? It's really good. The coffee is always fresh and promptly served, and the owner, Ma Roz, is great about remembering you after a visit or two. It's a very family-type place, both in that lots of families go there to eat, and also that there's a familiarity that builds up very quickly. After I had my wisdom teeth out, this was the first place I went to eat once I could chew solid food again.\n\nIt's a dive diner, sure -- but it's genuine, unpretentious (*cough* Taste of Dahntahn *cough*), and they serve some seriously good comfort food. The homefries are yummy as hell, and the breakfast sandwich is ridiculously cheap for the amount of food you get in it. \n\nAnd definitely, I recommend eating at the counter. The people who work there are great to talk to. As others have mentioned, though, don't forget your cash.", "user_id": "Or7fUkuJtQCwt4MRWF7pQg", "business_id": "SzHTdZR3yY1WBYUxkVxmUQ"}
{"text": "Marges is tucked away in the delightful Pittsburgh neighborhood of Mckees Rocks. This place reminds me half of a diner from the 1950's, and half my grandmas kitchen.\n\nThe seating room is accommodation, the service prompt and courteous.The prices are fantastic and so is the food.\n\nI had a grilled hodge podge combination of hot/sweet sausage, potatoes, eggs, and peppers all on one dish for 9.50. It was excellent. Ladies and Gents, I can put food away  like a champ and I still had leftovers.\n\nMy friend had a succulent, buttery French Toast. Simple, but they nailed it.\n\nI would return. Cafe Zinho is a quaint little spot tucked away in the hidden corners of Shadyside.\n\nI have driven by it many times without even realizing it was a restaurant. \n\nThankfully, my more knowledgeable girlfriend recommended checking it out, as she had to buy me dinner. Cruel world, I know.\n\nWe were able to get an early reservation on a Saturday, pick up a bottle of wine ( a must!) and make it relatively on time. Intimate is precisely the word I would use to describe this living room dining experience. The waitresses are what you would want your host mom to be like from a foreign country, and splendidly cheery.\n\nWe ordered two apps, both delicious. They also served some impeccable cornbread as well. The first app was a pastry sort of thing covered in goat cheese, that was worthy of plate licking, had it been socially acceptable. The second was a batch of clams in a fragrant tomato sauce (the sauce also went well on the goat cheese pastry). Most of the time when I order clams, they are far too fishy, but these were perfect.\n\nThe lady friend ordered the special, a quail dish, while I ordered lamb osobuco. The portions were very generous, and you could easily see the care and prep that went into each individual dish. I must say, the quail was divine. I ended up super jealous and contemplated tricking the gf to turn around so I could switch plates while she was distracted. It was a mixture of sweet and layered with spices, the meat juicy and rich. \n\nThe lamb was textured and cooked very well, however it seemed to lack a distinctive flavor to bring out the qualities of the meat itself. Perhaps more garlic or such.\n\n\nEither way, I will return, maybe with some Portuguese phrases in hand to banter with my adopted foreign mom/waitress. This is your hole-in the wall diner. It lives up to the expectations, and I will say this: get there early!\n\nI ordered something akin to a breakfast sampler, eggs, bacon, tater pancakes.  My friend ordered the raspberry french toast. \n\nThe coffee, as others have stated, was a bottomless cup. Quite tasty too, as compared with many restaurants that will serve you the dregs of Folgers that essentially serve as methadone to the caffeine connoisseur/addict such as myself.\n\nThe french toast stole the day, it was hearty and delicious, with a yogurt/syrup topping. Definitely an indulgence. I did not give this 5 total stars as my eggs were slightly bland, and I love eggs. I will return to this marvelous establishment that really serves as a gem in Pgh neighborhood eating. I am not sure what the other people were eating, but I had a fantastic hangover breakfast here. Everything is cooked on the griddle right in front of you, and it feels like you are in a family kitchen.\n\nEverything is very cheap, and the omelettes and potatoes were delicious. I will return. I just want to re-review this place for being so near and dear to my heart in Bloomfield.\n\nThis is a really quirky breakfast spot (Seven C's in Bloomfield is also a must) that out of towners and locals alike should take a minute to enjoy.\n\nI am not sure what the story of the owners is, but they seem to be ex hippies, and are always working tirelessly to provide simple and awesome food. \n\nThis place is also great for people watching, with the late night crowd. Some of the punk crowd that was more than likely jamming at Howlers will be present.\n\nOmelets, hash browns, fresh coffee, great sammiches- they always aim to please.", "user_id": "Ce-qdUhoBy7hJQUulYStWA", "business_id": "r8BwdblCW-ZUES37BL0khw"}
{"text": "An absolute must if you're going to a movie and want a drink ($3 drafts and $5 special martinis) and some half-off apps on a weekday from 5 to 7. However, we were bothered that none of the special martinis actually resembled a real martini. No gin or vermouth was used, it's mostly purees and champagne floats with flavored vodkas.\n\nAnyway, the small plates made for good \"upscale\" bar food. Half-price apps make for a cheap, but nice, dinner and a movie - great, great specials. However, I would not buy a full-priced dinner here. Nothing aside from the apps grabbed me for the outstanding price. The baked goat cheese was small but delicious, and the tempura fried shrimp was just right but the sauces didn't match up exactly.\n\nBe warned that the seats make you feel like you're going to be swallowed by them. Seriously, the booth was like sitting in the mouth of a whale. We came downtown on a Sunday afternon before a show looking for cocktails, seemingly this was the only place open on a Sunday. Olive of Twist is very dark, but it makes for a nice date spot. They found a way to make exposed brick walls and large indsutrial fans classy.\n\nTheir cocktails are absolutely great, at the top of the list is a proper gin martini with an olive or twist. They may also make the best sidecars in Pittsburgh, but for $8 - $10 a drink you should expect as much.\n\nThe calmari was excellent and we'll keep them in mind for their extensive dessert menu. A great neighborhood bar in the strip with authentic tasting Irish pub food. I'm a fan of going early (though it's so empty and lonely looking early in the day) for a brunch of bangers, rashers, and mash. Inventive cocktails, and events (on their calendar) are some high points. The bathrooms stick out in your mind though, because they're down some narrow stairs and seemingly so far away they might as well be in a different building. And they may be. I really wanted Alexanders to be great - like a hidden gem in a sea of Big Burritos and high-priced Shadyside Italian joints. \n\nWell, it was well priced, but the food was just... okay. They didn't go that extra mile to make it great. I had the blackened ahi tuna salad - the tuna was fantastic, but the dressing came in a plastic condiment cup with a lid and the tuna looked real lonely on some standard dark salad greens. Pasta portions were generous... but again, not fantastic. Joe Mama's actually has better pasta. \n\nHalf-priced wine by the glass - also generous. However there was lipstick permanently imprinted into the glass I got. The bar looks really nice and the dining room was more like a living room painted warm colors and filled with booths. \n\nI really wanted to like it. But I also wanted to comment on how the stellar review from an unknown source underneath the glass table top to read while you dine made it feel like some substandard tavern. I wanted to tell the waitresses screaming across the dining room to quite down because I can't hear the strangely out of place pop and rock music coming from the quality sound system over her asking if her customers want coffee with the dessert. \n\nI wanted a nice dinner at a beautiful restaurant. I got an OK one in a wonky dining room. If they take a step back and consider what they could do to make the place better, I think they can get there. However, that's not likely to happen without new management.", "user_id": "Xmuk68liVfhyG-WfsUt_hg", "business_id": "EoAY1JSVeJriBzId8lUQwQ"}
{"text": "This place should have a lot more reviews - but I'm glad it doesn't, they don't need to get any busier.\n\nIts been there ages, and looks it. If you're all about ambiance, don't bother. If you pretend you're in a movie set in Pittsburgh 30 years ago it works pretty well. The service is sometimes hit or miss. Most of girls are good, one is very slow, one is amazing. They are all friendly and usually a few different people will check in to make sure that you're happy. Everything is made fresh so be prepared that nothing comes flying out of that kitchen - busy times it can take a good while to get food. \n\nThe food is AWESOME! Worth any little complaints I might think up before it gets there. Once its on the table, I forget them all.\n\n-Fish Sandwiich\n-Salmon (huge and delicious)\n-Flounder\n-Shrimp a few ways (\"Norfolk\" style is oily for my taste, and I never had it growing up in Norfolk.)\n-Hawkins St Special\n-Prime Rib (sized for two, watch it)\n\nThe prices are low, the portions are large, and just about everything on the menu  is delicious. I'm not one to pick a place because they give you a lot of food, but if you like a good value and don't want to compromise on taste, this place is a gem. Its not bad. I'm not into chain kind of places, but if you're with a group that doesn't do anything more adventurous, you'll do fine here. I vacillated between 2 and 3 stars but the house beer I had will make sure I come back from time to time. Over all I like it, but its not going to be my main grocery run. \n\nI like having all the organic options, especially for the produce, beans and grains. I hate the parking situation, and their prices are significantly higher than I expect, even for organic. I like it. Veggie friendly too. Just go here, and order a battleship. If Kris makes it, its even better! After further investigation, I opt for the butcher boy. Fried jumbo. Jumbo? Jumbo what? Seems its a local delicacy you can only get in Pittsburgh - just kidding. I don't even like bologna but I actually drool thinking about this sandwich. Heck, I would practically be a vegetarian if I stopped eating here, but its so worth it now and then. Great pizza. Grandma's pie is an all time favorite! First off, I like family restaurants and avoid chains when possible. Sometimes that's not possible - in the future I'll avoid this one no matter what.\n\nIts always a zoo, the servers are not interested in what they are doing, and do it poorly. Food comes out of order or not at all. The managers don't care. \n\nWe actually had a waitress spill the soup, catch most of it in her hand, and dump it back in right in front of us. Then she gave it to us before thinking to ask if we wanted another. \n\nJust go anywhere else, it can't be worse! Loved it! \n\nI was not too excited about trying to eat healthy at an Italian joint, but went with friends. I was impressed at how many healthier options they had, if that's what you're in the mood for. Or pig out on a hot plate of carbs and dairy with a side of italian sausage.\n\nMy friends and I split an order of beans, greens and tomatoes. I regret the sharing part, it was so outrageously delicious I wanted it all to myself. Next time I'm getting my own.\n\nIn the spirit of healthy eating, I went with a salad, which was big, fresh, and just what I wanted. If you like salad, you're set. If not, the pasta my friends had looked great too. You can get gluten free or whole wheat pasta for an additional charge if you like. My boy friend had angel hair with alfredo, our friend had linguini marinara with fried calamari.\n\nThe waitress was very pleasant, and kept her cool even though she had the pleasure of serving this merry band of drunk, vicious old queens.\n\nNow I would have been sold on the service and the food, everything I tasted was great. But the two pasta dishes weren't all that hot. Somewhat warmer than warm, they said. My friend let the waitress know but wasn't unhappy enough to send it back, even though the manager was adamant they could remake  the plate in no time. (I work in a customer based industry and I know first hand, nothing can be worse than an unhappy customer who isn't willing to let you fix the problem after they bring it to your attention.) So at the end of the meal, he offered to buy us a round of drinks instead. Smart guy - offer a couple of drunks some free liquor, and all is forgiven. He took an almost great meal and made it great for them. Sadly, I was driving so didn't take him up on the offer. \n\nSo - great food, beans and greens, lots of choices, beans and greens, good service, and beans and greens. If it were closer to home I'd be ready to move in.", "user_id": "8fApIAMHn2MZJFUiCQto5Q", "business_id": "mVHrayjG3uZ_RLHkLj-AMg"}
{"text": "Tessaro's is one of those Bloomfield institutions that certain generations of Pittsburghers always rave about. It's a place that's (apparently) been around forever and just has a cool, old school vibe to it. The decor is totally out of date, just like the uniforms the servers wear. Who thinks that the white button down shirt with the little black tie works in 2012? The owners of Tessaro's do, which is part of the charm.\n\nIf you're in the mood for a tasty burger when you're in Bloomfield, you can't go wrong with Tessaro's. For my most recent lunch visit, I decided to change it up a bit and went for the cheesesteak with a side of boiled red potatoes.\n\nI chuckled when my food arrived. The cheesesteak was ridiculously large, overflowing with meat. The red potatoes came with a cup of melted butter for dipping. If you don't think potatoes should come with a cup of melted butter, honestly, you should go somewhere else... somewhere else where you can enjoy hating flavor. Personally, I assaulted those potatoes and didn't look back.\n\nThe cheesesteak was average. With some salt added, it was slightly above average. My advice to the kitchen would be to add some more salt and pepper while cooking to make it tastier out of the gate.\n\nTessaro's provides a classic Pittsburgh experience. While the food may only be worth three out of five stars, I'm going to add on another star because I like the fact that the dining room is dark, the menu is filled with meat, and the staff is friendly and efficient. Bottom line,  Tessaro's is a solid choice if you're in the mood for meat and you want to minimize your chance of running into Bloomfield hipsters. I visited Lot 17 on an uncommonly warm late Friday in October for lunch with a buddy from work. We were walking down Liberty and went into Lot 17 on a lark. I wish that lark would have kept me going down Liberty Ave. to find somewhere else with tastier grub.\n\nWhen we walked into the restaurant, it was totally dead aside from one other table of diners. I figured the place should be bustling since it was such a delightful day outside, but I soon came to realize why the place was a ghost town.\n\nThe simple lunch menu of burgers, sandwiches, salads, and wraps is nice and compact. I chose a turkey burger and regular fries, which arrived in a timely fashion. The fries were tasty... after I salted them. There was absolutely no salt of them when they came out. The turkey burger was seasoned well, but it was dry as a bone. I suspect the turkey patty was frozen, but the burger was so overcooked, I cannot say for sure.\n\nOur server was attentive and friendly. The building is clean, polished, and has some nice HDTVs. \n\nWhen I chose  to go to Lot 17, I figured I was trying it out for the first time. After we ate lunch, I realized I had gone there once in the past for lunch with other co-workers. What does this mean? Lot 17 is ultimately a forgettable lunch destination. Even with my below-average experience, I think the place has potential, but the execution was just not there on my visit. I hope they can step it up at lunch in the future. Alexander's is good, solid Italian food without any pretentiousness. Their menu is large, but not outrageously expansive like a lot of other local Italian restaurants in the area. There's a nice selection of Italian favorites, plus you have the ability to create your own past dish (choose your pasta, type of sauce, and add-ons).\n\nI've been to Alexander's several times for lunch and always enjoyed it, so I decided to take my girlfriend there for dinner on a recent night. When we entered, we were warmly greeted by the staff and asked where we wanted to sit. We sat in the front of the house/bar area so I could keep an eye on the Pirates game. While there, I overheard an older lady complaining that her dish was less than stellar. The server and the manager agreed with her assessment and offered to make her anything else on the menu to make her happy. I've always been pleased by the pleasant, accommodating nature of the staff when I've visited Alexander's; it's truly a strong point of the restaurant.\n\nI ordered the pork osso bucco with garlic risotto, while my girlfriend went with chicken parmigiano. We opened with bruschetta toast. It was a nice start. The tomatoes were fresh, and the taste of balsamic vinegar gave it a little pop of flavor. I then had their wedding soup, which is always enjoyable. It's full of meat and has just the right level of saltiness to it. My girlfriend was pleased with her garden salad; in particular, she enjoyed the flavor and texture added by walnuts and cranberries.\n\nThe pork osso bucco I received was huge. Unfortunately, the flavor was not as big as the size of the dish. The pork was tender and properly cooked... the garlic risotto, not so much. It was just kind of bland. Together, the dish was fairly tasty, but not something that I would order again. My girlfriend was pleased with her massive serving of chicken parmigiano and pasta. It was good, but the breading was a little soggy because it was doused in sauce.\n\nSomewhere during the course of our dinner, the manager walked from table to table, and asked every group if they wanted a loaf of Italian bread. I suppose that they had a lot of extra bread and were giving it out since the night was winding down. I heartily accepted- their bread is delicious. Little things like this are why I love Alexander's.\n\nIf you're looking for some tasty Italian food served in a friendly, welcoming atmosphere, you can't go wrong with Alexander's. Just stick with the pasta, and you'll be happy.", "user_id": "CQnjJKIMuRJj-tpyhZ5HMg", "business_id": "vgXE1I7c9ElcfYyZfQiN1Q"}
{"text": "Went here this past Saturday afternoon, 11/2. My friends and I sat at the pretty much empty bar for over 5 minutes with no service. The bartender walked by us a few times and didn't even acknowledge we were there. As we walked out, we saw the bartender on the phone and other staff members standing in the back chatting. We went next door to Mad Mex and got much better service! This is one of the only German restaurants I know of in the area. The meal was good and reasonably priced. They also have a good beer selection on draft and in bottles. We had a party of 6 going for a 7:30 dinner on a Thursday. \n\nBigger parties tend to chat a little more and take longer in my experience. I felt like they were sort of rushing us out. That might be because they closed the dining room door and started vacuuming the front bar room while we were still finishing up our dinner. I'm not sure if anyone was eating out there but I'm very happy we weren't because it seems really gross to me to vacuum around food. This was around 9:15 and I'm pretty sure they serve until 10. \n\nBesides that, our service was good and so was the food. We all split the stuffed pretzels and potato skins as an appetizer. The pretzels are delicious, I could have eaten them all myself! Deep-fried and stuffed with cheese, yummy! \n\nI ordered the Chicken Viennese and was pleased with my meal. It came with a choice of two sides and I went with a delicious sweet potato casserole and my favorite thing of the night: POTATO PANCAKES. I prefer sour cream, but you can also get applesauce. Yum yum yum get lots of potato pancakes! The chicken was delicious and was served over spaetzel, which was just ok. I've had the kase spaetzel there before which is served in a cheese sauce and much better than the regular. \n\nThere was a variety of entrees ordered from sausage platters to wiener schnitzel and everyone seemed pleased with their meals. You get a lot for your money and I'll never turn down a chance to eat potato pancakes! I stopped in for lunch here one day and was very impressed. It's located in the strip, but at 28th so it's not impossible to find a parking spot!\n\nThe food was good, the staff was friendly. If you are looking for something more than your typical deli sandwich, this is the place for you. They offer cold and hot sandwiches, wraps, etc. I ordered a turkey wrap, which was good, but after tasting my friend's corned beef, I should have gotten that! Definitely hearty sandwiches that will not leave you hungry! Had a great meal here! The food was authentic, delicious and the older man who was our server was adorable!  I loved watching him joke around with the kids at another table who seemed shocked and intrigued by his heavy accent. My friend and I both ordered noodle dishes and were very pleased with our selection. I will definitely try this place again! Joyce was a great server. She took great care of our party of 7 and was very personable. \n\nCheap, average diner food. You can have subpar breakfast, lunch or dinner at any time of the day! Best consumed late night when nothing else is open. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to go here besides a late-night drunk snack. A good, reasonably prices Italian restaurant in Bloomfield. We went on Halloween around 7pm and found that is the absolute best time to go out to eat! It was completely empty except for two other parties. They bring you bread and oil to the table. We also ordered bruschetta which was very good. Everyone seemed very happy with their meals. \n\nBeware of the pasta Diablo! My dad was sweating from the heat of it and he normally loves spicy food. He said it was delicious, but it sounds like a great dish for someone prepared for some serious spice (not me!). My little brother was disappointed that his spaghetti and meatballs came with one meatball, but besides that we were very happy with the meal.

{"text": "the closing of the cafe is surely a sad thing.\ni first went to the cafe when i was in college, then when i took my first job downtown in 1977.  and i \"found\" it again when i started working downtown again several years ago after being out in the burbs for years.  i loved going here for lunch as it was quick, it was not pricey, and the food was consistently good.  nothing fancy.  no tofu.  no edible art.  just the kind of comfort food your mom would make.  \nsince i moved to arizona and come back monthly for business trips, it is still on my list of places to hit while i am here.  i was scheduled to meet a friend there today :(\ni am so sorry to see that John lost everything in an attempt to keep his dream alive. and i am sorry for pittsburgh as yet another independent is lost.  hopefully, the building will not turn into yet another fast food joint or over-priced noveau cuisine establishment.  no matter what - it will never be able to replace the cafe. If I could give more than 5 stars, I would!\n\nNow, I will be a tad sentimental here.  Thai Cuisine was my first experience with Thai.  A friend brought me there for lunch back in 2006 - and I have been a junkie ever since.  And, to be perfectly honest, I have only found one other place in the burgh that I think has comparable food in terms of taste - and the prices there are much higher.  We live about 45 minute drive from TC so for us to frequent there means that we really do enjoy the food!\n\nOver the years, DH and I have brought many friends to TC.  To be honest, it is not much to look at.  It really is lacking in atmosphere and, to be honest, I would love to see them clean up their restrooms a lot.  But the service is always good and the food - well, the food is so good, I can live with this little \"diner\".  Besides, we always end up down the street afterwards for a coffee and there are restrooms there :)\n\nWe have tried all of the appetizers - DH says it is hands down the best hot & sour he has ever had.  Steamed dumplings are the tastiest in town - good taste but nothing overwhelming (i have had them with so much garlic, I regret eating them). Spring rolls are always tasty & fresh.  BTW - if you go at lunch, they add a tiny salad with peanut dressing to your plate - try not to lick the plate when you are done :)\n\nI think we have tried every curry on the menu - red, green, pineapple, panang, musman, winter.  Winter is always our favorite - a green curry with the pumpkin is to die for.  DH will scrape the bowl on this one. \n\nI am a noodle junkie.  My favorite here of all the dishes is their Pad See Ew.  I always get it with shrimp which are nice-sized and plentiful.  It is the sauce that differentiates this from other Thai places.  TC uses a sweet black bean sauce that is amazing.  I have tried this dish and it is the sauce that makes this dish.  I have liked their Rad Na and enjoyed the fried rices but I always come back to the Pad See Ew because I know that I can't find comparable anywhere else.\n\nI will admit that we have never tried desserts there. To be honest, we find the portions plentiful and have never wanted dessert afterwards.\n\nIf you are looking for atmosphere, head to Squirrel Hill or the South Side or Wexford. If you are looking for tasty food at a reasonable price, this is your spot.  And just remember - there is always takeout!", "user_id": "YZaIJvg38rlYKwPlsgYc-A", "business_id": "A2XkbJ07hrR80t0EFgLikQ"}
{"text": "We came here on a Saturday night and luckily it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be. I love playing ticket games so luckily there were a lot of games to chose from and not many video games (sorry video game lovers!) We only played $20 worth of games and surprisingly we were there for awhile. I love their new Wheel of Fortune game! On our first play, we ended up winning a little over 700 tickets! They also have Fruit Ninja as a game. It was fun with the big widescreen but unfortunately you don't win as many tickets as you would hope. I wish their ticket center would have individual ticket counters like the other D&B's I've been to, where you feed a counting machine your tickets. At this place, they just weigh your tickets and give you the final count. We didn't try the food here and instead went to P.F. Chang's to eat before coming here, but the Eat & Play deal looked fun. Too bad it was only restricted to certain times of the day. Overall I had a blast here and definitely would come back. Hopefully next time when there is a deal or promotion. So I have never been to P.F. Chang's before since I'm Chinese and I'm not a huge fan of eating at Chinese/American restaurants when I can eat delicious authentic Chinese food at home (courtesy of my momma). My boyfriend and I were at Dave & Busters and weren't in the mood for American food, which was what we were all surrounded by so I decided to give P.F. Chang's a try. \n\nWe came on a Saturday night without reservations, so we had to wait 45min :( Luckily time went by fast while I was on my phone looking at the Yelp reviews for this place. When we were seated, we ordered immediately and our server was very friendly. We got the salt and pepper calamari as an appetizer and then the Dan Dan noodles and Shanghai shrimp with garlic sauce. The food came out quick which was a huge plus considering how busy they were. The calamari was okay. I felt like the strips were cut too thin and we should have received more. The Dan Dan noodles were actually very delicious and flavorful. I really enjoyed them and definitely recommend them. The shrimp was cooked well and was also good. Overall I was happy with my first time experience here and would consider coming back if I'm ever in the mood for Chinese/American food. Came here for lunch on a weekday with the bf and during our meal, I noticed it started to get really crowded, which meant this place is a go to spot for Thai food. The lunch prices here are very affordable and the service was friendly. The fried wonton pieces they gave us before our meal was sort of stale though. Anyway, I got the pad see ew and it was okay, borderline pretty good. It wasn't as flavorful as I hoped it would be compared to the other Thai restaurants I've been to, but again, it was still good, just not memorable. You also get a good amount of food too for the lunch specials. We ended our meal with the mango & sweet rice dessert and it was tasty. The rice was cooked perfectly and the mango was ripe and sweet. Overall the food was good (A-ok), but I sort of feel like I've had more flavorful Thai food at other restaurants. But I can see why people come here for a quick and affordable lunch especially if you are craving Thai food.", "user_id": "7R79mN6iJNU6o0CI1aBesA", "business_id": "sbW8qHJgzEIH42B0S-3New"}
{"text": "It might be a \"hole-in-the-wall,\" but it's a pretty nice hole with some decent looking walls and amazing food.  Tram's has, arguably (though it might not be much of an argument), some of the best tasting food in Pittsburgh, period.  An instant bonus star for being extremely vegetarian friendly.  \n\nMy date and I split tofu spring rolls which were fresh, delicious and went well with the peanut based sauce provided.  For the main course I had tofu vermicelli which was by far the best item of food I've had since I've moved to this city.  With generous amounts of tofu, vermicelli and whatever coconut based heavenly sauce they put in it, it's hard not to finish an entire bowl.  Throw in some Sriracha and garlic hot sauce and It's almost too good to be true.   For desert we split an order of \"banana cake,\" which sounds kind of stupid, but is actually incredible.  I have no idea what they put in it--maybe a rice based cake, with some beans cooked in, topped with coconut banana cream with sesame seed garnishing?  Really though, who cares?  You just accept it for what it is and eat because it's delicious.\n\nAll of this food for two people with prompt service for $25.  How could you not give this place 5 stars?  A big shout out to Tram too.  I think he's the dude with with amputated arm. He's the man.  \n\nDon't' come here dressed to the nines, expecting a ritzy meal.  Do come here for great food in a casual, yet clean and hospitable environment.  You won't be disappointed. A solid neighborhood bar, just a short walk from my workplace.  My coworkers and I went out here after work.  It's a nice little cozy environment that just has a comforting feel to it.  Plenty of flat screen TVs to catch the big game, though not sure what their channel options are for out of town games.  I'd have to go back to investigate.  Otherwise, the service was solid, the drink menu was decent, and the food was good.  I had the nachos which were pretty average to slightly above average in nature.  The guacamole was actually good though.  Nothing to write home about, but decent enough to enjoy.  And yes, I'm a stickler when it comes to guac.  Overall, I'm giving this place 4 stars because this is simply a cool place to chill after a long day at work.  Give it a try and see what you think. I have mixed thoughts about this place.  The first time I had food from here was when I was working and a  couple of co-workers wanted Thai.  It's nice that we have a place so convenient to our hospital.  Unfortunately during that time, I had to wait an extra 20 minutes past the estimated pick-up time for our order before receiving the food.  The order was received correctly, however my tofu pad thai just tasted a bit bland.  Not sure they got the sauce right or something.  It's not that it wasn't edible, it just wasn't very tasty.  Kind of meh, if you will.\n\nFast forward 3 weeks later when my co-workers and I went out to eat at the restaurant this time around.  The service was decent and the food was fantastic.  I had the spicy noodles which was a great mix of thick noodles, veggies and tofu.  Just a couple of critiques:  I think it's stupid that they charge you $1 extra per person for BYOB.  Also, their policy which states no separate checks for parties of 5 or more, is kind of annoying.  Otherwise, I'd consider eating here if you're in the area.  Though it is worth nothing a far superior Thai restaurant, Pusadee's Garden, is right up the street.", "user_id": "fhNxoMwwTipzjO8A9LFe8Q", "business_id": "dxCqGkhtXq-9fYEsX7Mf6Q"}
{"text": "Food was NOT GOOD at all! My husband & I ate here a couple weeks ago for the first time. I ordered a salad & basil pesto cream pasta & my husband ordered the spinach & feta pasta. The salad was just a huge plate of spring mix (nothing else in it) with WAY to much vinegar dressing. My lettuce was drowning in the vinegar. My pesto pasta had no flavor (did not taste like a cream sauce to me) & the pesto was so runny/watery & way too much sauce not enough noodles. My husband's pasta had even less flavor than mine. We ate about a quarter of the food & couldn't even finish it. We took it home & it was so bad I didn't even eat my leftovers. And I hate wasting food!! Plus the prices are expensive for the amount of food you get & of course the poor quality. Don't waste your time eating here. There are much better Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh. Casbah is great! They always over deliver; whether it be the service, the food presentation or the quality, freshness and uniqueness of each dish starting with the appetizer all the way to dessert they never disappoint. Their menu is constantly changing so you never know what you'll get each time you go. \nI also love the atmosphere & eating outside on their patio. \nCasbah is a must try (and ask to eat on the patio)! Sushi Three is my favorite sushi restaurant in Pittsburgh. Their food is always excellent. I've only eaten in the restaurant a couple times, I usually order take out. The vegetable spring rolls are delicious. They are crispy, not greasy & the dipping sauce they come with is so good! It tastes like a wasabi mustard combination. Cold sesame noodles are good. My favorite makisushi is the spicy salmon tempura roll, they fry the outer shell of the sushi so it's crispy & it's lightly topped with sauce. The Shadyside Roll which is smoked salmon, cream cheese & avocado, any of the vegetable tempura rolls which is a choice of yam, broccoli, asparagus or zucchini & the fresh salmon roll are all great choices. \nYou can't go wrong with Sushi Three. If you're a fan of sushi they are a must try! Dor-Stop is your pretty stereotypical diner. From the food to the decor to the atmosphere it's diner all the way. Their breakfast is always good but nothing to write home about. \nMy favorite are the pumpkin pancakes! So thick and full of flavor, some of the best I've had. Also the home fries are made fresh not frozen. You can really tell the difference. And the food portions are huge! \nIf you go to Dor-Stop on the weekend it's really hard to get a seat without having to wait a while. \nI would definitely recommend trying Dor-Stop..they are quite popular around here with the locals. Thai Cuisine is just ok, there's nothing that makes them stand out from other thai restaurants. Around the city of Pittsburgh there's a lot of Thai restaurants so you really have to make yourself stand out over the other restaurants and Thai Cuisine just doesn't have that quality.\nI started with spring rolls and veggie Tom Kha soup. The soup was very good. The spring rolls were good and the dipping sauce was ok, nothing special. \nFor my entree I ordered the veggie bird nest noodles (crispy noodles). I didn't think it was that good. There was WAY too much sauce, it was almost a soup and the sauce didn't have much flavor at all. Also the veggies were sliced too big, they should have been cut into smaller pieces, it would have made the dish more manageable to eat.\nI'll eat at Thai Cuisine again if it's suggested by someone else but it won't be my first choice for a thai restaurant.", "user_id": "bmy45XLtOomcc_EvC-lXRQ", "business_id": "P1fJb2WQ1mXoiudj8UE44w"}

Yes, on name alone, haha. After being told that they don't deliver to me and then that they do, the actual order took place. No, you can't get double or extra pepperoni(-1 the pizza is not that good that they can dictate what you want on it) or extra cheese. No, you can't get a menu and no we are out of Hot Sausage. Too many \"no's\" to me. No, we don't have Coke or Pepsi. No, we don't have bottles.(-1 for all the \"No's\")\nLarge Pie with Pepperoni and Ham\n2 cans of Mountain Dew \n$19.18, seemed a little expensive compared to prices on Mt Wash, where this would have been $14-$16, no mas. (-1)\nThe delivery occurred ahead of the stated 45 minute time, delivery guy was great.\n The dough was a little tough, in fact my jaw hurt after 2 slices. I tried another piece about a half hour later and it was really tasty and the crust was a bit softer. I also like the \"Dirty Crust\" (+1), they flip the crust down to size covering a presauced section, putting a small bit of sauce inside the crust. They sauce the crust edges sloppy and get cheese all over the top, Dirty Crust. Yummy! Hunan Wok is a strip mall Chinese joint in Kennedy Township. When walking in, you are overwhelmed by the smell of cleaning products, how dimly lit it is and a lot of the signage and calendars are dusty/dirty(-1  overall appearance) , just not real appealing. It was around 2:30 and empty. I ordered L24 General Tso's, yea I know, real adventurous, but I do ask for it Hot every time.  I was told 15 minutes, it took 20 and they were dead slow(-1). The General Tso's was about as flavorless as you could get and o, so dry(-1).  The Pork Fried Rice was actually Pork Burnt Rice, nasty(-1). I also ordered Boneless Ribs, which were pretty good. Not a lot of fat on them.\nEnded up paying $13 for a lunch special that didn't come with a drink(-1).\nOverall, odds of going back are a lot slimmer than me. I totally forgot about Mad Mex. They have a good menu, not that I would eat much of it. They have a great Bike night, getting hundreds of bikes, but not Harley's. I went here after reading all the great reviews here on yelp. I was not disappointed and I don't believe my companion was either. It was a Friday night around 9 and the place was packed. We got right in and was seated in less than a minute.Our server came right to us for our drink order. We both ended up ordering burgers, I had the BBQ and it was bomb, delicious. O, and they came so fast, I mean  I was expecting a long wait considering I ordered mine Medium Well. Very good all around and the bill was round $40 for 2 burgers and 4 drinks. Fiori's has the Best Pizza on Earth, hands down. I have been eating there since we moved to Brookline in the 70's. My god, this pizza is perfect, the sauce sweet, the pepperoni crispy, with a small pool of the, oh, so good grease. I always dip my crust in it , heh. They have some Shakies behind the counter if you ask. Expect to wait if you stop while bar hopping and actually even finding a parking spot, can be a task.

BOO!\n\nAnyways, I ordered the shrimp cocktail to start.  It was okay- 6 nice sized shrimp served in a martini glass with cocktail sauce and 2 lemon.  Not bad, the shrimp could have been a little colder.\n\nFor dinner Kev had the buffalo chicken wrap with onion rings and I had the cobb salad with a side of balsamic vin.  I like the cobb- avocado, chicken, pieces of bacon, toms, egg, lettuce.  It is good but nothing special.\n\nOur server was nice.....\n\nThe food here is just very blah.  The atmosphere is good to watch a game.  \n\nThat $25 coupon didn't get us very far.  We ended up paying $54 with tip and with the coupon!

Nor is the food good enough. love the lobster roll.  buttery delicious stuff.  the crab/spin/artichoke dip was also yummy.  i'll go back and try other dishes.  so far so good went back here last night and the service was extremely slow.  in fact our waitress may have been tipsy.  \n\nwe waited for a solid 20 minutes before receiving menus.  we asked for drinks at least 3 times.  thankfully, our food was good and made it out after we ordered at a somewhat normal pace.  \n\nthe calamari was good and enormous in portion.  it comes with a side of marinara with red pepper flakes.  i liked the kick.  it's garnished with sweet peppers and pamesean cheese.  yeah for the calamari!  hence the 3 stars.

Pasta trio- oh those mushroom ravioli\n5.  Tiramisu- my favorite part of the meal...just incredible\n\nDouble date night...friend encouraged me...thank you so much.  Pleasure!  \n\nOh and friends husband switched the Caesar for the seasonal beet ensalade...looked beautiful.  I dislike being one of those peeps that just ain't in to beets.  Colorful beets too...yellows, reds, simply gorg.\n\nGreat Groupon because this meal would have been $130 or more.... I've been here twice and ordered to-go once.  The food is bad!  Last night our table ordered French fries, stuffed portabella mushrooms, and calamari.  The best of the dishes were the mushrooms stuffed w crab meat and topped w red peppers...the fries and calamari were terrible!  I don't want to come back here...it's over priced and the food is below ave i highly recommend this pizza.  i'm a fan of several different pizza styles and this is a good old medium crust style.  it's more on the side of ny style pizza with that medium sized crust.  i tried a large mushroom with half pepperoni.  they bury the pepperoni under the cheese (minus one star).  i prefer seeing the pepperoni because of the fact we only wanted half the pizza with pepp and couldn't tell which side was which.  we had leftovers and i wasn't as big of a fan of the cold pizza from here.  i will say though, this pizza fresh from the oven- the best i've had yet here in pittsburgh.", "user_id": "fFoRIzbwpMiv3BvfdtdlXQ", "business_id": "McikHxxEqZ2X0joaRNKlaw"}

I'll try them next time I'm in the 'burgh.\n\nPizza Perfectta has a few stools and a counter but really it is a take-out place. I'm a N.Y. thin crust guy.  This pizza is the antithesis of N.Y. style pizza so I didn't really get it.  It's just not my taste but it may be yours so read on.\n\nI went with a born & raised Pittsburghian who hasn't lived in the 'burgh for a decade.  He had fond memories of this place so late one night we set out for Beto's.  He was surprised to find that the place is now housed in a fairly new upgraded building giving off a somewhat upscale vibe.\n\nEven though it was after midnight, they were still serving take out... so hooray for their late night hours.  We orders some \"cuts\" (Pittsburgh's way of saying \"slices\") to go and ate them in our car in the parking lot.\n\nFor the former Pittsburgher, the place may have changed, but the pizza tasted just as he remembered.  Tangy sauce, cuts in rectangular shape, crust was bready but had some crunch on its underside.  The unique thing about this pizza is they take it out of the oven and then add the cheese... and alot of it.... so its not altogether melted when you eat it.  My friend loved it.\n\nTo me it was unique but just okay.  I like a thinner crust, cheese melted and cooked all the way through, crust less bready.\n\nYou may like it.

{"text": "updated Peppi's 2, Pep Boys 0.\n\nPersonal Experience: This was the second Peppi's I ever visited, back in the old days.\n\nI absolutely loved it! It took about 10 mins to make my Roethlisberger, and the whole time, the guy was telling me about the shop, about the sandwich, and asking where I was from and how I heard about it. He was fun and interesting and interested in me. It felt like I had a friend. That's the kind of service which is hard to come by these days.\n\nWhat's more, the sandwich was spectacular. It always is, but he seemed to make it extra greasy, and he put 2 eggs on there instead of 1 for me even though I only asked for 1. Some of the best service I've had anywhere, actually.\n\nI would come back to this location, or the Strip District one, over all the others. I love it. Best service. Miles better than Primanti's.\n\nAnd more info:\n\nThis place has some of the best subs in Western PA, especially the delicious and appropriately named Roethlisburger, my favourite! Yum!\n\nWell, well, well. Long before I was ever officially into food and having friends and local fans of my music pick out where I was supposed to eat in any given town I was visiting, I knew about Peppi's. That was because I was once watching the Steelers on a given Sunday (during their famous Cowher Superbowl Winning Run I think), and I saw a special on this little sandwich place making a Roethlisburger. It seemed like they put everthing imaginable on it \"plus an egg\". The \"plus an egg\" thing intrigued me, so when I finally made it to Pitt, I gave it a try.\n\nPlus an egg indeed! My word! It's actually spicy minced sausage (greasy as hell) with all sorts of goodies on it.... er... \"plus an egg\". It helps that these folks are some of the friendliest people you'll find. The Strip District folks asked for a signed CD and gave me a free Roethlisburger in return. The Downtown location gave me a free portion of fries because I had to wait about 30 seconds longer than they said I would have to wait. So really, whether you're looking for good service or good sub sandwiches (is that really a choice?), Peppi's is a great selection. I'm sure a lot of their other food is good too, but anyone that names a sandwich after the local hero and my favourite (joint) QB, is going to get my business, and since that sandwich is so delicious, it's the only thing I've ever ordered since I started going there. updated Hell hath no Fiori's like a woman scorned, and let me just say that other cities have no women like Pittsburgh women. Yes, Ricki, yes, Gina, yes, Alley and yes, Julie, I am talking to you. Spectacular.\n\nEdit: My 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th time at Fiori's - spectacular. I love the taste of the dough and the cheese and sauce, it's just so different to what they serve in Buffalo and elsewhere. It's wonderful, especially when it's fresh and the dough is still floury and doughy.\n\nSo anyway, my second time at Fiori's - not as good. The pizza was okay but it was definitely nothing special on my second visit. Maybe it's the best in the Pitt area, but it doesn't hold a candle to Buffalo or Chicago Pizza, so I have to reduce it by a star. That's really sad too because for some reason I had Fiori's as one of my top 10 Pizza in the country... I must have been really hungry that night or something!\n\nMy old review is below:\n\nwow, this Pizza is really, really good! I love it! It's the best in Pitt! And get the side of cheese, it's really worth it! It's cold and lovely and goes with it really well! Definitely a big time 5. 5/5\n\nIt is a little hard to find this place because it's hidden away, just across a bridge and on an incline up to the West End, if you don't know Pittsburgh well you could get lost, but then again that could be said about any location in Pittsburgh really, couldn't it. Definitely not the easiest city to drive around, but one of the most fun (except in snow or ice, which is common).\n\nThe people here are friendly (yes, I said friendly, Pittsburgh sometimes gets a bad rap), and as I said, the side of white cheese is an absolute must - mmmm. Locals in Pittsburgh told me this was the best Pittsburghese Pizza out there, and as far as I can tell they were right. I don't have anything to compare it to, but I will definitely be coming back here when I return to Pitt.", "user_id": "5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ", "business_id": "pvGT62T6Ci1LKOS9DL42pg"}
{"text": "Rock Bottom is a chain brew pub one that, in my opinion, is just \"OK\".  The restaurant is rather large with lots of seating and a pool table. They have many of their own brews that you can sample but to tell you the truth none of them are that good. I have had several of their beers and all of them have been forgettable. \n\nTheir food is pretty much like their beers, forgettable. I have had one of their burgers and their pizza and they really weren't anything to write home about.\n\nI feel they will impress those who have never been to a brew pub but I would probably describe them as the Chili's of Brew Pubs. If you are in homestead and are looking for a burger and a beer it might be a good choice for a bite, or at least until the Burgatory opens! I have a friend that loves this place, and I have been told it's the best German food in Pittsburgh so I had to give it a try.\n\nI had the Roasted Loin of Pork Stubenkuchen Style with German Style Potato Salad, and Sauerkraut. Everything was really good. The Pork was delicious and that mushroom gravy that they put on it was nothing short of amazing. I want a whole bucket of the stuff to put on everything. The Sauerkraut was interesting featuring shredded pork mixed in. The german potato salad was good but was pretty much what I expected. \n\nTheir draft  beer Selection left a little bit to be desired but featured 5-8 beers many of them popular german style beers. \n\nI got a good idea what this place is all about and I have to say that I will be back for more. Pumpkin Pancakes are to die for. Actually all their pancakes are to die for. This is a place featured on the Food Network's show \"Dinners Drive-in and Dives\" that did not disappoint. \n\nA local place run by a local family of friendly people. Affordable prices, delicious pancakes makes for a gem in the downtown area of Dormont, PA. Their hot dogs and fries are affordable and good but even though they have like 300 different beers in bottle their beers are over price and will triple your tab. That and yet have a limited draft menu. This is a place that I can really get behind. You can't beat a $9 burger that is freshly ground and cooked on a 600 degree wood burning stove. \n\nThe local butcher shop in Bloomfield closed its doors, so Tessaro's brought him on board and now they have their own butcher to handle all their meat preparation.\n\n I'm a big fan of this place you have to check it out. What can you say about Fiori's. i'm going to just start throwing out some words and stop me when you get the point. \n\nlegendary, awesome, fantastic, sweet, cheese...oh so much cheese...., epic, beautiful, famous, iconic, local, unique, different, quality...... I think you get the point. \n\nFiori's is all of those things and more. They are, in my mind, the best Pizza place in Pittsburgh. I know that is a highly debatable topic, but when people from the North Shore bother to go to south hills to a little hole in the wall place with no parking and hardly any room to eat inside, you know it's good. \n\nI lived in Brookline for 2 years and would frequent this place. I would say that eating the pizza in the shop is better than taking it out. Even though it's a small place it's worth it to go to that lightly crispy crust something you don't get when it sit's in a box waiting for you to pick it up. \n\nAlso the cheese is the cats meow at this place to don't even bother putting toppings on your pizza. The topping is overshadowed by the sweet sause and the mountain of cheese so don't waist your money. It's better that way, trust me!", "user_id": "Yvn7DHj7o7sSCH2rNH74Mw", "business_id": "McikHxxEqZ2X0joaRNKlaw"}
{"text": "So, groupon made this evening possible.  Thank you, groupon.  Picked my husband up from work in Market Square and walked over to Olive or Twist at about 5 pm. Parkings a b***.  I'm so glad we walked.  It was happy hour on friday and the bar was packed FULL.  Buzzing with business men and women looking to loosen their collars for the weekend.  The place seemed alive.   We edged our way around the bar to the hostess table where we were warmly greeted and sat quickly (make a reservation though...we were only sat because aparently another party canceled even though the dining room was empty? whatever its fine) Was a little too loud from the bar, for a couple looking for a romantic dining experience but I'm not complaining.  We were seated in the dining room wich has beautiful rustic brick walls revealed and a warm ambiance.  I was really excited about the menu. Everything on it sounded decadent.  So much so, that I couldn't decide and ordered TWO entree's!  I never do that.  I ordered the Fettucini Boursin (reccomended by the waitress) and their \nPear & Candied Pecan Salad (I added chicken for $2)  \n............. The salad--- FABULOUS.  Bleu cheese crumbles atop mixed greens, a crisp fresh sliced pear, and the most amazing strawberry vinagarette I have ever had. The chicken I added was very juicy. The only downer about the salad, is I hardly got any candied pecans... they were few and far between and when I did get some, they were more like candied pecan crumbs you find at the bottom of the bag.  That just told me the chef for whatever reason, must have been out of them.  But if your going to call it a pear and candied pecan salad, it needs to have a reasonable amount of pecans.    ...............................Next, was the Fetuccini Boursin.  The waitress raved about this, and I think I see why.  They top it with a yummy sharp cheese shaved in a pile that is really delicious. But for me, the plate in general was a bit dry and the sauce was the consitency of elmers glue..not just thick, I mean... sticky and dry.  I like it more moist.  In my opinion, Olive Gardens fettucini is better, but it satisfied my pasta craving, nevertheless.    My husband ordered the Carribean Jerk Chicken Sandwich with a side of broccoli instead of fries.   HE LOVED EVERY BITE.   He was hesitant to even let me have a taste he wanted it all to himself.     Our waitress was so kind and welcoming.   Overall, it was a great experience.  We enjoyed it and it made for a nice evening.  We will probably come back,but not without another coupon.  Its questionable wether the food is truly worth full price or not, but thats just my opinion.   I really want to try their happy hour drinks.  They looked delicious, and obviously they are, if they are drawing such a crowd.  This is a nice little place :)  Give it a try. ************ALERT:  THIS PLACE IS CASH ONLY!!!*************\n\nWe just moved to Pittsburgh last winter and have been trying to locate an excellent Pizza place.  Most places we have tried seriously missed the mark-- often tasting like pizza you could get at a bowling alley.  We live in Brookline so we passed Fiori's a number of times, but finaly decided to go in.  Its been our go -to Pizza place ever since.\n\nTHIS PIZZA IS FANTASTIC------- IF YOU ORDER EXTRA SAUCE ON THE PIZZA!!!!\n\nThats why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.   It REALLY needs extra sauce.  I also agree with a previous reviewer that the Pizza is better,  as just plain cheese.   Skip the pepperoni and other toppings.  They just distract and cover up the amazing taste of the sauce cheese and crust. Plain cheese with extra sauce at Fiori's  is where its at!\n\nWe usually get a Large 16\" cheese Pizza with extra tomato sauce which costs $14.95.....\n\nI'm telling you, you HAVE to order extra tomato sauce.  Forget extra cheese---- its already loaded with Cheese.    Their crust is fantastic , but it soaks up A LOT of the sauce, so you don't end up tasting the sauce much---- (unless you order extra)  wich is sad because their sauce is AMAZING!!!!! Sweet and tangy. ...  When you can taste it..... SO  JUST ORDER EXTRA SAUCE. Okay??? :) Trust me.\n\nThey do not deliver and have very little parking available, and they are STILL always packed.    Just extra confirmation that its GOOD PIZZA!  \n\nIf you MUST take out, fine.   However,  I recomend Din-In whenever possible. Eating their pizza 3 minutes out of the oven, is quite a different experience than eating it after its sat in a box for 15-20 minutes.   Not that it sucks by the time you get it home....Its just waaayyy better right out of the oven.  Its a signifigant difference in flavor and texture. ORDER EXTRA SAUCE, too!!!", "user_id": "6So27Aw1p6W-Un-fsMYDPw", "business_id": "OxIeMVcop5oxBUWANi-1Rw"}
{"text": "Alexion's has been around forever.  The first time I went in there, I was 19 years old on summer break from college and working at the ice cream factory up the hill.  All of the union guys from the ice cream factory went in there after work, and I immediately found out why.  MANY, MANY years later, I stopped in there with some fond memories, and once again felt welcomed and valued as a customer, even though they didn't know who I was.  THE SANDWICHES are done Pittsburgh-style, sort of like Primanti's, and they are as perfect today as they were back in ancient times when I first started visiting the place.  Alexion's is a clean and peaceful little place in the Rook Station part of Green Tree, the oldest part of the town.  I recall that some of the sandwiches I got there were ordered at a pretty late hour.  Nothing but good things to say about the place, and I wish it was closer to home! Cain's is a TREASURED INSTITUTION in Dormont, and of course, it's a neighborhood favorite  It's a lot better for those of us who don't live in Dormont now that there is a parking lot across the street, but do be careful if you are attempting to cross West Liberty Avenue during rush (happy) hour!  I've been stopping at Cain's since I can't remember when, and maybe their tap selection has something to do with that.  I have never failed to find something interesting and crafty on tap at Cain's.\n\nMy favorite night to stop at Cain's is Wednesday.  I try to get there early, because later in the evening, the place is usually packed out, even though there is a lot of seating.  On Wednesdays, Cain's has a special on their excellent chicken wings.  They are done the right way, and among my top favorites in the South Hills.\n\nYou can't go wrong at Cain's during happy hour.  Half price on all appetizers and a dollar off all drinks from 5 to 7.  But my favorite plan of attack at Cain's is to arrive around 4:45 and order the \"half sandwich and a soup\" deal they call \"express lunch.\"  It is served until 5:00, and you can't beat a half sandwich and two sides for $5.99.  By the time my food arrives, it's happy hour and the beers are a buck off, but you have to be seated in the bar area, supposedly.  My favorite sandwich to get with this deal is the Reuben, served with some volcano chili and slaw, but I've had other interesting sandwiches there as well.  The chili has got some NICE punch to it, and I am definitely a fan.\n\nI remember way back when this place wasn't so pretty, but they have done a nice job with updating the place and you won't be embarrassed to bring a date to this place.  But don't be surprised if you end up having to stand for quite a while before you can get a seat on a Wednesday night.  Chivalry is not dead in Dormont, which is one of my favorite parts of the South Hills, and I have seen young men give up their seats in favor of older ladies at Cain's.  Good people. THIS is an old-school pizza shop!  I'm sure that many of the foodie-types who frequent Yelp are going to dismiss this place, but having heard so much about it from my local pizza-loving friends about the pie at Fiori's, I finally decided to stop and order a couple of pizzas to go while I was in the neighborhood.  The sauce definitely isn't for everyone - it's a departure from the typical corporate pizza crap that everyone has gotten used to.  But the sauce is INTERESTING, and the crust is PERFECT.  A little too much flour used when it was flown, but I'm guessing that's because the place was doing such a high volume of business.  The pepperoni reminds me of the old Mineo's pizza, small slices that curl up and produce little grease pools.  WOW, now that's the pepperoni I love, and definitely not the pepperoni you'll find at Papa John's, or Vocelli's, or Domino's, or Little Caesar's, or Pizza Hut.  This is the PIZZA of your youth - the pizza you remember your dad bringing home, complete with the relic-style pizza box.  It's not in my neighborhood, and I'm lucky enough to live close to Luciano's, but if I'm hungry and in the vicinity of Fiore's any time soon, I won't hesitate to grab a couple more pies - maybe one for dinner and one for breakfast!", "user_id": "4-3IU5uUH90m21TWbZhhnA", "business_id": "KayYbHCt-RkbGcPdGOThNg"}
{"text": "This is a really fun way to spend an afternoon. After several visits here, I've found a couple games that are easy to win and score you lots of tickets, and others that are just a blast to play. We did really awesome last time we were here, and their prize room is full of some pretty neat stuff. \n\nTheir food is not too bad. I've only ever eaten here once, and it wasn't that memorable, but I didn't hate it. I did like that they have a bar, and they had my favorite beer on tap, that was nice. \n\nLike pretty much any arcade I've ever been to, there are things that are a rip off, and occasionally something won't work properly. That really irritates some people but I figure no arcade is perfect. At least none that I've ever been to. The most irritating thing for me is that some of the games have a call button on them that signals an employee to come assist you, and I kept hitting the button with my leg or something, so every once in awhile someone would randomly appear at my side and ask if I needed help, and I would be really confused. haha. \n\nWe went here with my husband's family on Thanksgiving, and we had a total blast. The whole place was pretty empty, and I felt really bad for the employees that had to work that day, but it was nice for us! Tiny little ordinary looking Beto's somehow manages to be an interesting pizza place. How? Well, remember the pizza lunchables you used to get as a kid, where you put all the cold toppings on top of your little pizza shell? That's essentially Beto's pizza, only about 50 times better obviously. It comes in massive slices with cheese and toppings spilling out all over the place. Their sandwiches are massive and delicious. (They will toss those in the oven to melt the cheese.) \n\nThe place is super tiny, and it can be difficult to find a table, but we've never been left standing, and I've been there a decent amount, normally with the Sunday lunch crowd. There's really absolutely nothing special about Max & Erma's. In fact I would say it's probably about the most boring chain restaurant out there. No wait, Ruby Tuesdays still exists... but at least they have a salad bar... hmmm. Anyways, the only reason I keep coming back is because my husband's family LOVES to use their back room for every occasion. Ugh. Can't we just have get-togethers at someone's house like normal families do? \n\nSo since we are forced to show up for family functions I've had cause to try much of the menu, and most of it is average or below. The only thing that has been consistently good is their tortilla soup. If you're not getting that, don't bother. I've heard about free cookie Wednesday, but come on, is that really going to drum up that much business? At Eat N' Park, free cookies are a staple. Get it together Max & Erma... My husband's relatives love Fiori's, and I've grown to love it too. Apparently it was a neighborhood hangout for them when they were kids so they have a sentimental attachment to the place... I just like the pizza. The restaurant area is small, nothing fancy, and crowded on weekends, so we pick up and take our pie to the in-laws, who live close and usually don't cook for us when we visit.\n\nOur favorite seems to be the mushroom and pepperoni pie. I'm always a fan of a pliable crust with a thin layer of mildly sweet sauce and a THICK layer of cheese. I adore cheese. So based on my preferences, this pizza really does it for me. \n\nThe ultimate quest for the \"best pizza\" is a tricky thing.  Everyone has different tastes and stipulations when it comes to their favorite pie, which makes me wonder: Is there really a \"best pizza\" out there? There is most definitely BAD pizza, and you have only to look at most major chains to find it. Fiori's qualifies as a good pizza, and probably the best I've had from this area of town. So maybe that is all there is to it. Pizza can be good or bad, but no pizza is going to be perfect for everyone. And that's my pizza theory. \n\nYou're welcome folks.", "user_id": "R4crU2OjJ7-qAymiHO2Ucw", "business_id": "sbW8qHJgzEIH42B0S-3New"}
{"text": "I love this restaurant and I probably go about once a month; however, there's just something about the inconsistency that gets me to just feel like it's not quite there.\n\nMad Mex offers a funky decor and typically quick service.  If you plan to go on a Friday or Saturday night, I suggest reservations because there's nowhere really to relax indoors when you are waiting for a table.\n\nBeing regulars, we have settled into a few choice menu items.  If you bother to read the menu, you'll notice a few jokes hidden in the description of items, so even if you are a regular, it's worth a read.  We always start with some chips and pico or the Picka Dippa and some margaritas.  The black bean dip is to die for.  Slight bit of spice, creamy black beans and a little bit of melted cheese.  The beer cheese isn't my favorite, so that one is never ordered, but we regularly switch up the salsa choices.  For margaritas, we have settled on the Ultimate margarita or the Don Julio VIP.\n\nThe burritos are huge.  Seriously, as big as your face type of huge.  At this restaurant, you will definitely use your silverware.  Of course, they are filled with a lot of rice and beans, so I recommend to pay extra for double meat to make a more desirable meat to starch ratio.  The chimichanga is great, but pre-made so they can't accomodate any changes.  The tacos and fajitas are good and come with nice warm flour tortillas.  Enchiladas tend to be oversauced, but overall good.  \n\nThe food tends to be quite consistant and you get what you expect, but other parts of the meal tend to be hit or miss:\n1. I think it's the sour mix, but something about the margaritas tends to be really inconsistant.  Sometimes you get a strong one, sometimes not so strong.... Sometimes you get a sweet one, sometimes you get a sour one.  It's never terrible by any means, but you really never know what you are going to get.  The Greentree location has the most variation in the margaritas while McNight road's margaritas tend to be better more often.\n2. As off-season tomatoes tend to be finiky, sometimes the pico is fresh and flavorful, sometimes you get the gritty or cardboard-ish tomatoes.\n3. Some of there servers are great while other times you get one that leaves you wanting more from the service.\n\nIn contrast to another review, YES, they do appreciate you on your birthday.  None of that childish singing or a flamboyant dessert... if you are on there list, you get a birthday card for a free burrito.  That's better than any of that cheesy crap.  Although a casual dining chain restaurant typically isn't worthy birthday dinner fare, if someone's giving away a free burrito, I am there. I am a big fan of It's Greek to Me in Brookline.  This tiny little place at the edge of Brookline doesn't look like much, but it has a real family character, cheap eats and tasty food.\n\nI have dined in twice and got carry out twice as well.  The first time I got a platter/dinner, but I found the deal is really to be had with the gyros.  Getting two gyros and a huge amount of fries for only $10 is a steal.  The gyro bread is toasted, but still soft and it is loaded with meat like your grandma would try to feed you.  The veggies have always tasted fresh and it is served hot.  If I could change on thing, I would prefer fresh herbs on the gyro instead of dried.  This gyro is definitely more spiced up than your chain restaurant gyro.  The fries are fresh cut and nothing is cooked until you order it.\n\nIf you choose to dine in, you will be greeted by the proprietor and casually asked to take a seat any where you like.  This isn't the type of place for formalities.  She will offer you some delicious Greek Tea (you have to try it) and take your order, cook it and then serve it to you.  Sometimes you can hear bickering in the kitchen between her and her old man- but that only adds to the family atmosphere.  The store does take credit card, so that's a great modern convenience.  At the end of the meal, we've always gotten a stick of gum :)\n\nIf you choose to carry out, it's a simple call and your food is ready by the time you drive down there.  There is usually a place to park near by and you can be on your way quickly.", "user_id": "aAlTMcBf-0Q9DewxhoCdEQ", "business_id": "hhNlQWaKqGbMPoeZHoL-IQ"}
{"text": "Forget what you know about pizza. Beto's is entirely its own thing. And it gets five stars because it is something you will crave more often than is healthy.\n\nA Pittsburgh favorite, I know multiple folks who've moved out of town and include this on their \"must do\" list each time they come to town. (Visit pap, watch the stillers, drink an iron city, eat a few slices of Betos pizza - check!) \n\nAnyhoo, the crunch of this pizza crust makes me go weak at the knees. I just want to HEAR everyone at my table bite into their slice of pizza...is it so much to ask? Then you experience the perfectly thin layer of sauce. Then the mound of shredded, uncooked mozzarella cheese, some of which falls to your plate for you to snack on later. And you realize, I'm eating pizza but it's a whole other experience entirely because the cheese and toppings are raw! I like getting anchovies on mine because the salty bite with the rich cheese and deluxe crust is, in my opinion, the perfect bite. It is the stuff dreams are made of. 4.5 stars\nHad a lovely anniversary dinner here with my hubby (first year of marriage behind us, all downhill from here lol). I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant from the moment we stepped in - old warehouse turned into a cozy place with beautiful built-ins on the wall and cool glass fixtures. Reminded me a bit of our first apartment, so I was instantly excited that we chose Lidias for the special occasion. \n\nWe were promptly greeted by a server with water and a tasty bread basket. I loved that the bread is served with a black olive tapenade and pesto as well as olive oil. Added an extra level of quality and tasted awesome on the fresh breads. I was then pleasantly surprised to see a $32 wine list. My hubby doesn't care much for wine, but encourages me to order a bottle if it's a special occasion. I always feel bad spending too much, so this was a perfect option. The waitress helped me choose a dry white wine that was very nice with our meals.\n\nThe entree was wonderful as well. I almost always order frutti di mare at Italian restaurants so was pleased to find a similar dish on the menu - zuppa di pesce. Incredibly flavorful broth with delicate little bites of pasta and seafood cooked to perfection. I would definitely order it again next time.  My hubby had the pasta trio and loved the mushroom ravioli that they were featuring.\n\nMy only gripe is that the tables were reallllly close together. The waitstaff couldn't even get between the tables to fill our drinks or bring pasta servings. I know from a business standpoint, you want to maximize your seating, but it went a little overboard. It was also Valentine's Day weekend so  they may have split 4 tops into 2 tops, leaving less space in between than usual. I'll have to pay attention next time I done there. Awesome spot. I've visited for drinks and pool a few times in the past, but dined there for the first time this weekend. I expected standard bar food and was super impressed by the homemade quality of everything we ordered.\n\nAfter 8pm, they have a special low-price menu with $4 appetizers,$5 sandwiches and burgers, and a great wing and pitcher special. We ordered both appetizers to share amongst the group. The provolone wheel was literally a round of provolone breaded, fried, and topped with sauce. Best eaten by just digging in with a fork, it is melty cheesy goodness. The tomato sauce was spot on as well, just sweet enough to cut through the richness of all the cheese. The fried zucchini was the real surprise - amazingly light, crispy breading with a mild seasoning. I've never really liked fried zucchini because it tends to get soggy and limp. I don't know what their secret is, but I would order this fried zucchini every time!\n\nFor my meal I enjoyed the burger with american cheese. It was juicy with a nice chargrilled flavor (reminded me of a good quality Burger King patty haha, I mean that as a compliment!) and the toppings were fresh. A solid burger. My hubby quickly devoured the meatball sub so I didn't get a chance to try it, but he was impressed. We both enjoyed the homemade fries that accompanied the sandwiches - spice blend game strong.\n\nThe bartender that's usually working is super sweet and makes sure that nobody waits too long for a drink. The owner is an awesome guy as well. Always comes out to say hi to the regulars and introduces himself to anyone that he doesn't recognize. Overall, a really great local bar/restaurant.", "user_id": "j-W6oGoQtKnzncCRZhji1g", "business_id": "93UCt9OgWYmypZCpXtUu8g"}
{"text": "My husband and I stopped going here, back in 2010, because of the bad service we were receiving. We used to call the servers \"Whole Foods Rejects\"; they were always cranky and we felt not welcomed, rushed. At the end of 2011, I think they got a new manager, the service has been optimal and we haven't stopped going since. Their food is delicious as well as their drinks and coffee. Almost everyone is leaving a review for the taco stand outside of Reyna Foods which has nothing to do with this grocery store!\nThe taco stand is owned by a different person, not by Reyna Foods. They may use their totillas but the food is actually made by Edgardo (the old Taco Loco owner) and recent owner of Edgar's Mexican Cuisine. \n\nReyna Foods does carry everything you need to make an authentic Latin dish (I know, I'm from Argentina and I can find anything here) but their prices can be high; like for example their empanada dough. They only carry brand \"La Salte\u00f1a\" (from Argentina and the best brand out there) they are frozen though. I'm still hoping for them to get Goya or other ones (that wont come to mind at the moment). \nThey also have many argentinean brands of Dulce de Leche (I don't care if this one is pricey because as fattening as that is, and as tempted as I can get with one pot, I don't mind not being able to get it). And Yerba Mate, all of the brand from Argentina and Paraguay, and they also have them in flavors.\n\nUPDATE (Dec. 2013): Reyna food has replaced Edgar's tacos stand and Edgar's tacos has been moved around the corner, closer to Pamela's on 21st Street. You can't miss it. Have you guys been here in the daylight? This place is filthy! \nI understand this place is old, but wash the curtains (they look like they've been in a flood) and those glass lamps hanging from the ceiling. The woodwork and floor are sticky. \nWe had a Guinness (in the wrong glass I must add) and didn't have the stomach to eat anything. \nAll this place needs is a good wash. Let me know when, we'll go back. Don't waste your time!\nOh, where should I start..?\nMy family and friends came here for a Sunday lunch. The prices are crazy high (for -cheap- pasta). The menu outside the building and website doesn't match what they show you at the table. One of our guest was the last one to receive his perfectly square cheese ravioli and the filling was still frozen! (You'd think that for a $16 ravioli plate you'd get home made). After they microwaved it it was barely fit to eat. Some had flavorless Chicken Piccata, Fish and Eggplant Parmigiana. The atmosphere didn't help. The only thing with an aroma in this place was the tomato sauce. \nI don't understand the big fuzz some make about this restaurant. What a joke! I left a few reviews for lunch menu's in this area because my coworkers and I like to try new and local comestibles once in a while.\n\nFirst thing, they need to change the font on their menu. We could barely read it! \nOne of us ordered two Kibbee Footballs and didn't know that they only got one in one order. That was the only bother with this order.\nWe had their Falafel sandwich, Baba Ghannouj, Beef Shawarma sandwich, Stuffed grape-leaves, Muhammara; everything was delicious. \n\nThey also had Baklava to sample at the register and all I can say is that I've ever taste Baklava this fresh!\n\nNot to mention the store itself; I haven't seen it in years and they have since fixed it up and added a Caf\u00e9.

{"text": "This was my first time at this location.  I've frequented the Upper St Clair Galleria restaurant.  There's a lot to like about this Columbus OH based chain.  I don't usually eat at chain restaurants nor will I review them because they're typically big food corporate run places that don't care what they feed you they just care about their stockholders.  This place seems different to me.  The food quality and care seems to be very high.  \n\nThe staff is always well trained.  I like the decor and ambiance.  The menu offers many options.  I don't really like the fish preparation options very much and the portions can be small in some of the dishes but overall I am a fan.  I do really appreciate being able to buy fresh fish here.  I like to buy the trout and prepare it at home.  \n\nWe were here for a Thanksgiving meet-up event with 69 other people.  The room was a little small and it ended up being too loud too but the staff really pulled it off overall.  It's a tough thing to do.  It wasn't perfect for sure but the food was surprisingly good and came out hot and fresh.  Nicely done. My wife and I have been eating here for many years now. We almost always go for the lunch buffet and have eaten here at least 25-30 times now. The menu items change every time we're here so sometimes we like it better than others and range from really thrilled by the food to feeling it's ok but are never disappointed. The owners/staff are really very nice too and they serve you fresh naan to order. I am writing now after all these years because another Indian restaurant opened a stones throw away and I want to make sure you try Namaste instead. The service and attitude at the other are just this side of rude and indifferent. Yesterday, I had baigan bharta, chana masala, palak paneer, pakora, chicken tandoor, onion naan and masala tea and all were very very good.  I skipped the chicken curry, carrots/peas, rice and tomato soup but thought I would list them to give you an idea of what else they had yesterday.  All for $7.95. I hope you'll stop by and give it a try. This is the best Pittsburgh has to offer in authentic Vietnamese.  I have eaten here several times in the past 7 years or so and have tried several of the items on the menu with success.  I like to order bun with chicken and pork spring rolls.  I also like the Hieu Tu.  Basically chicken pho but with chicken broth instead of beef.  This is typically my go to dish here and it's very good.  It's a small family run place without a lot of slick ambiance.  I wouldn't say you'd be wow'd by the decor but the service is friendly and efficient.  I am always glad I dined here. This is a really cool Middle Eastern market with a counter top dining area.  You order at the register and either take it to go or sit around the perimeter of their kitchen area on stools.  They have a nice menu of classic pita sandwiches, salads and your favorite sides.  I tried the lamb burger.  It was terrific.  It had feta, arugula, pickled onions and a garlic mayo on ciabatta.  I'm missing something here but you get the idea.  I ordered in medium and it was perfectly pink throughout.  \n\nThey had live music on Saturday.  I enjoyed the music while I ate then strolled the market and sampled some olives, perused the hummus and baba ganoush selection and was tempted by the dessert case.  They have oils, bins of pulses and frozen imported delicacies and cheeses from far off lands.  They make their own pita and you can see the production line behind glass as you shop.  This place is totally worth checking out and I'll be back soon.", "user_id": "oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg", "business_id": "usSROUMiAgPcxV3Ym0OxMQ"}
{"text": "Another really bad Pittsburgh pizzeria that all on you yinzers can't get enough of.\n\nEverything about this place is inconvenient.  They do not deliver and its pretty hard to find parking on the Aggro Crag-esque hill that the shop sits upon.  The interior is dirty and uninviting...I would even go so far as to call it \"rapey\".  After illegally parking with my 4 ways on and waiting for a few minutes one of the employees gave me my pie and I headed home.\n\n\nThe pie it self was a real mess. It is obvious just by looking at the pie that whoever made it took no pride in making it well, they just threw everything together and plopped it in the oven on a wing and a prayer.  \n\nThe dough is some of the worst dough I have had yet in Pittsburgh.  They are using regular deck brick ovens and cooking the pies directly on the brick so there is no excuse for not being able to achieve some sort of crunch.  It is very dense and flavorless with no crunch at all.  The taste of salt and sugar come through a little bit in a very generic way, almost like a Papa Johns tasting dough.  The main problem was that  the dough obviously didn't rise at all and was very dense and hard to chew.  Its a dry dough too, very dry.  Plus the pizza was made so poorly that the middle of the pie was paper thin and inedible while the outside of the pie was way too thick and was hard to chew.  Basically what we have here is another bowl-like pizza where all of the ingredients pool into the middle because it was made so poorly.  \n\nIt is pretty clear who is wearing the pants in this pizza, good old Uncle Cheese....and the pants are soaked.  I watched the kid making one of the pies and he just filled up both of his hands with 2 pounds of cheese and tossed it into the middle of the pizza and just kind of scattered it towards the outside and said \"yeah, that will do\".  They are using a really high quality cheese and it does have a great taste and it has that gummy effect that you would get if you ordered extra-cheese.  Unfortunately there is just way way too much of it for the pizza to even be edible in some spots.  You couldn't even pull a slice off of the pie to put it onto your plate without pulling all of the cheese off into a big pile in the middle.  They are using lots and lots of cheese to compensate for how bad the best of the pie sucks.\n\nThe sauce is very forgettable and watery.  They put very little sauce on the pie anyway and its applied with no pride in the traditional lazy bulls-eye pattern where you sauce in some spots and none in others.  The sauce has a bit of a sweet taste, un-offensive and maybe tasty if they were to ever put enough on for anyone to taste it.\n\nIn general this is just lazy pizza where they would rather give you 2 pounds of cheese than actually have to take pride in their food.  I feel my butt hole starting to cry as I near the end of this review, save yourselves the T.P. and just leave this one alone.  \n\nI am giving it a 4 out of 10. This is a perfect example of a really disgusting Pittsburgh style pizza, you guys love this awful crap for some reason.  \n\nI called in and asked how big their medium was, the idiot responded with \"8 cuts\" which obviously tells me nothing considering you can cut anything into 8.  When I asked again he said 14 inches so I ordered a medium cheese and an order of breadsticks.  \n\nI will confess that I didn't actually try the pizza because I had to send it back because it was well past the point of being edible.  It was like pizza soup in a crust bowl. \n\nThis place is using deck style brick ovens, which is about the only thing they are doing right.  They do not cook directly on the brick though, they use pizza screens.  The screens that they use are the ones with the really big holes as opposed to the grid style screens that everyone else uses.  I have never seen another shop use the big hole screens, and probably for a reason because the dough was really really terrible cooked.  It was burned to the point of being black on the bottom at (which I usually don't mind at all) but somehow they managed for it to still be completely doughy and soft and not the least bit crispy.  Honestly it seems like some kind of miracle of science to have a black pizza bottom and for it to not at least be a little bit crispy.  The pizza was definitely on the overly thick and doughy side and even if it had been cooked well it probably still would have been too doughy to be very good.  The dough recipe may or may not have tasted good, no one will probably ever know because it will probably never be cooked evenly enough to even have a chance at tasting good. \n\nThe biggest problem with the pizza overall was the 2 pounds of cheese sunken into a large gelatinous wad in the middle.  It smelled like decent cheese, probably Grande (although probably cut with something cheaper).  They are wasting so much money on cheese its sad.  Whoever the pizzaman was obviously took no pride in it whatsoever.  The sauce was all dropped into the middle with most of the cheese.  The edges of the pizza had big bubbles where all of the cheese and sauce should have been, but they were NOT the nice crispy kind of bubbles that could be enjoyed...just lumpy masses of sadness.  \n\nI can't comment on the taste of the sauce because I am not a brave enough man to have put a slice of this DIY toilet clogging kit into my delicate stomachular system.  Fake words aside, this pizza really sucks guys. \n\nThe icing on the cake were the breadsticks, a side item that I consider to be pretty un-f*ckable.  So for breadsticks, Mr. Bellesario (BTW, I hope that this is just some made-up Italian restaurant name and that someone doesn't actually put their family name behind this crap) just cuts up slices of the premade Sicilian dough and slaps some oil and herbs on it and calls it breadsticks.  Its the most ghetto attempt at this particular appetizer that I have ever heard of.  Its pretty funny, really. \n\n\nSo yeah, this place is definitely worth avoiding at all costs especially considering the prices aren't even good and the restaurant itself is completely filthy inside.  The owner was nice enough about refunding the money for the pizza.  Its a shame when I see businesses like this that are set in their ways and are really wasting their potential with a general lack of pride.", "user_id": "6yLu1rQdr9bn7QoeHRXgRA", "business_id": "r8jeeS3k_diihMDSu9IjlA"}
{"text": "I had the \"curry plate\", though it was actually a big bowl. It was enough for two meals! And very tasty. I usually like some bigger pieces in dishes like this but was totally fine with how minced this was because it was just so good. I added a picture.\n\nThe service did seem a little poor considering it was only us and three other tables in the place for lunch. We had to wait at least 10 minutes for the check and another 10 minutes standing at the cash register to pay while the person behind the counter talked on the phone.\n\nIt also was a little sad that the pita I paid $1 for was so small (and not included with something like a curry plate already). The slaw had a slightly strange chemical taste but was still good enough to eat due to how fresh the vegetables were [and I didn't really order it, it just came with the dish]. I wasn't expecting much (as I'd never heard of this place and randomly walked in today) but I didn't leave with much either.\n\nMy dad and I both had very average-tasting hoagies for lunch. I had a chicken parmesan hoagie. It was quite overcooked and I still have the taste of burnt breading my mouth. This is the only Thai I've had so I might just be reviewing Thai food generally as being good, but I couldn't imagine asking more out of this restaurant. The tables and seating look much nicer than the price, which was under $10 for me I believe for just a curry/meat/rice bowl, which was more than filling. My dad ordered the same thing and asked for \"9\" spiciness, but did not think it was spicy at all. I asked for \"5\" not really sure what the scale meant and it did not taste remotely spicy (which was fine).\n\nWe've gone a second time and both got the same thing as the first. Don't mess with a good thing, I guess! Today, I had seriously the worst experience I have ever had at any restaurant. I have a feeling that the manager was not in.\n\nAll five of the employees that I saw were under 18 (which, as a 21 year old, is not entirely an ageist comment). Even though there were only five customers in the store, it took nearly 20 minutes to prepare all five orders, after they were already taken. The cashier also had a lot of trouble counting money--her goal was to give me back $7.02 in change, but took the $5 out, said \"Oh shit,\" out loud, thought for a second, and then I reminded her that I need $2.02 more.\n\nAll five orders had exactly one item missing from their trays, and all of them were things that the cashier was responsible for. She forgot my chips for my taco salad, the cheese for two other customers, an incorrect drink for another. My drink wound up having zero carbonation.\n\nI finally made my way to the condiment counter, which had ketchup smeared all over it, including on the stack of ketchup cups. There were literally zero napkins, so I had to go ask for some from behind the counter.\n\nMany of the tables had a stray napkin or straw wrapper. While eating at one of them, one of the employees was in the dining room, yelling towards the counter (from about 20 feet away), \"Can you please tell Gary to fucking change these garbage cans?\" about five times. The cashier responded that she doesn't want to \"yell\" at Gary again.\n\nAs I cleaned my tray, I discovered the reason the garbage cans so desperately needed changed--I tried all three in the restaurant, but all of them were so full that I could barely open up the swing door on them, let alone put anything inside. I finally settled for putting my full tray on top of the entire garbage receptacle, for I had no other option.\n\nNone of this is exaggeration. I was seriously appalled.", "user_id": "Zgtsv5A0EFLO6Nm25-Aluw", "business_id": "PzG0XmAmtXFs6Fdnubf41g"}
{"text": "Terrible wait staff  couldn't even seat us. Before we, and another party walked out without even being greeted properly, I observed several employees traipse out the front door, several tables who were waiting for their food for a long time,  several employees just standing around out of direct view of the tables, a morbidly obese hostess that could barely physically walk from one end of the store to the other. I think one server was high. \n  \n  Going there was a  special request by a 7 year old getting over a long-ish illness, so that makes the shabby treatment more enraging. Ordered General Tso's shrimp, Kung Pao chicken, soup and egg rolls. Price was slightly higher and portions maybe slightly smaller than similar stores, but food quality was certainly in line with food of this type.  \n  The only notable ding I would give is the spicing. Both of our dishes are supposed to have a bit of spice flavor, and they are noted on the menu as spicy dishes, but there was a notable absence of spice.  There weren't even chilis in the Kung Pao sauce.  It's like someone forgot to spice the dishses. I tried the \"cold cheese and toppings\" slice that Beto's is famous for.  If you have heard about there style of serving pizza, and are wondering what the punch line is, there isn't one.   They make a big square tomato-sauce pizza and throw cold shredded cheese and other cold toppings on it, and that's it. There's no secret ingredient or special something  that makes it tastes like anything other than what you would get it you grabbed pizza fixings from your kitchen and forgot to bake them.\n  \n I guess a lot of people like it, and more power too them. But I don't get it. Ramblin' Boy didn't get it. I see zero reason to agree with people that say that this is the \"best\" pizza in the region. \n\n Maybe their hoagies will be better. Yep, it's a chain. Yep it's the but of a lot of jokes by the \"In the know\" set.  Yep, it is kind of inexplicable how long the wait can be on weekends. Yep, I know it's more politically correct to eat at a  locally-owned family restaurant.  \n\n But you know what? \n\n I've never once had a bad meal there.  I've never once had less than top-shelf service there.  I find Olive Garden restaurants have consistently higher quality not only compared to the other franchise stores in it's price range, but also notably better than some family owned Italian restaurants I could name. Pretty interior, spiffy soda fountain,  Worst. Service. Ever. \n\n I've had multiple problems with the crew in this store since they re-opened, but yesterday evening took the cake.  I went in to pick up some last minute food for the family and was immediately suspicious when I saw half a dozen people milling about unhappily at the food pickup location, an no one giving them food.  When I questioned the cashier about the delay, another customer actually came back and demanded a refund because she couldn't wait any longer.  When I noticed that half of the crew seemed to be sitting in the dining room watching TV. \n  \n I've been to this store frequently and there is definitely a pattern or very very poor and incompetent service. Almost every order I've placed had something forgotten or incorrect. There are always crewmembers milling around doing nothing, playing with the TV or in case, rapping behind the counter.\n\n I've just had it with this store, I plan on avoiding it until the get some people actually interested in serving their customers, and I would strongly advise others to do the same.  At this point I wouldn't even trust the food that comes out of their kitchen.\n\nUPDATE:   I was able to reach a regional manager via email, and he replied briefly that it was a situation that was being addressed.  In the last month, I have been there 2 or 3 times with simple take-out orders and everything seemed to go fine. Got what I ordered in a reasonable amount of time and everyone on the crew were if not working, not blatantly goofing off. So added a Star to the rating, even though I'm still kind of leary.", "user_id": "uPp_2Ni_-I5jwzfu182Xpw", "business_id": "6ilJq_05xRgek_8qUp36-g"}
{"text": "Someone please change the cooking oil!! With the construction on Rt. 51, it has been a very long time since I decided to put up with the craziness that makes up this intersection. A nagging for fried fish however, sent my daughter, and me to this LJS. Mistake number 1 was ignoring the deserted parking lot. Mistake number 2, was placing an order at the drive thru, and eating our 2 piece fish and more dinners, after the smell of old cooking oil put a damper on our nagging for fried fish.\n\nThe service at the drive thru was friendly, the girl at the window friendly, but the smell of old cooking oil, not so much. Not a soul in sight at this LJS. Yes, there are other places to get great fried fish, and after our experience, perhaps it's time to let this LJS walk the plank off our list. The fish was edible, not the usual crunchy, crumbly LJS fish. The hush puppies were soggy from either drowning in old oil too long, or sitting under heat lamps too long. The fries, endured the same sad torture as the others. Cheap, yes, but not worth the money, or Rt. 51 traffic anymore. A few friends from out of town wanted to meet at Sushi Kim for dinner, so I agreed. The sushi selections seemed to satisfy their tastes, while their kids liked the miso soup, and edamame beans (which were replenished when asked). \n\nI'm not a fan of Japanese food, so I stuck with the Korean selections, after all I was in a Korean restaurant! I had Mandu Guk, which was a good size bowl of meat filled dumplings, and broth. My daughter had the pork bulgogi which she liked, but we've had better. The pork was really greasy, and not cooked on a fire grill, no char marks, equals less than tasty meat. \n\nSushi Kim alternates between a hit, or a miss. Sometimes you get a few different panchan, (side dishes of pickled or marinated vegetables), and sometimes you only get kimchi, wth? If you judge a place by it's patrons, I've seen few Koreans eat here, so that sums up the authenticity factor. Nice big restaurant, just lacking in overall experience. Was in the neighborhood, and decided to stop at Ritters for a late breakfast. Parking isn't fun since it's either on wild Baum Blvd. or parking in the Ritters cramped lot across from the diner. We hit the 11:00 crowd, but were seated in under 5 minutes. The waitress was friendly, even though she was keeping up with a few other tables in the section. I got the 'new' Greek gyro omelete which was good, the homefries were standard potatoes, a little bland, but okay. The vanilla milkshake was great, and was exactly what you'd find in an old diner. The wait for the food wasn't too bad, considering the crowd size, and the food was good, nothing too extraordinary. Happened to have Tong Garden because it was close by, and not pizza! The hot and sour soup is okay, thick and heavy on the white pepper, not my favorite. Silver Palace on Rt. 88 has a much better version. \nThe steamed dumplings are tasty, but I almost want to bet they are pre fab, not made in house. \nMy favorites are anything and everything spicy, although I always request extra spicy, and the Kung Pao chicken, and beef have both been tasty. The version of Ma Par Tofu was good, but heavy with oil. \nConsistency is usually there, but a few occasions, I was told a different cook was in the kitchen, and it tasted like it. Sweet and sour pork ordered for someone was a disappointment.\nTong Garden is okay for something different, reasonable prices, and always friendly service. Not a regular go to, but it'll suffice in a pinch.", "user_id": "WcDdWdsxmOYPxtbRRr1IaA", "business_id": "BbIh5NTizhV4Fq_mLmNkpg"}
{"text": "God i hate eat n park. Only reason i have gone is for the salad bar because u cant find a decent salad bar in this city. Just about every entree iv had here is nothing more than rubbish, except maybe the cheesteak. Only go if u have little kids Good breakfast, horrible service.. And im not even one to complain about service. One of the waitresses is always in a bad mood with an attitude. Fire her and ill raise the rating to a solid 4 I don't really get the great reviews. Maybe its more the nostalgia of them reopening than any thing. The pizza bagels were decent at best and their \"homemade\" tea is basically lemon water. Both i could easily make better at home. Ill give their pizza and hoagie a try, but theres too much competition in the area (Sunseri, Amilis) for them to stand out I thought D's was beer mecca of Western PA until i recently discovered House Of A Thousand Beers. The latter is a bit of a drive, but you won't see anything like it in the area. That being said, I stopped in Ds today and i must say the cave is slowly but surely going down hill. They use to have countless hard to find beers, Ottos, etc. Hardly saw any of that today. And what specialty beers they do have costs an arm and a leg, and can be found for cheaper elsewhere. For example, $14 for a 12 oz bottle of Wulver and $25 for a bottle of Angel Share! Whoever is actually subjecting themselves to those outrageous prices are literally getting robbed. You can find a $25 four pack of Wulver and a $10 single of Angel Share at Giant Eagle.. In fact, you can find most of the beers in the cave at Giant Eagle at a much lower price... Shop smart and mix and match a sixer at Giant Eagle for half the price. Beer selection: 4.5 stars\nFood: 3.5 stars\n\nThis location is my favorite mostly because it doesnt seem to get quite as busy as the other locations. As with all Mad Mex's, the draft beer list is always great with a broad range of styles. Youre sure to find a beer youre in the mood for.. And happy hour is hard to beat with half off drafts and wings from 4:30-6:30pm on weekdays. The burritos seem to be a hit, but i think theyre overrated. The nacho grande is huge and loaded, and tastes alright. Wings are pretty decent, especially with their blue cheese. All in all, id say come here for happy hour to feel the full affect of Mad Mex I thought the gyros were just okay.. too much seasoning. Fresh cut fries is a plus.  I come here for the lunch special ($10.50 for two gyros and some fries). Great value If you live in Brookline, look no further, this is your one stop shop for Mediterranean/Middle Eastern quisine. You can eat in or take home some groceries. Iv had their falafel gyro and regular gyro. The falafel one was very good with a healthy dose of both falafel and fresh veggies. The regular gyro fell short of my expectations however, the lamb being mushy and slightly gritty. I plan on trying more items on their menu and possibly grab some groceries, but if you just want a good ol gyro, Sams Sun Sandwich in Carrick or Original Gyro on 88 are better options The gyro platter was very good although not the best iv had therefore getting a solid 4 stars", "user_id": "AEQowxQ8076LsWNirwHTww", "business_id": "eznh0XjVtv924K-KYx_ilQ"}
{"text": "What a disappointment!! Evening started pretty badly and did not get much better.  \nWe had reservations for 5 people at 7PM this past Saturday. Two of us were there early and rudely treated by the hostess. She was vague about seating us and we decided to wait at the bar. When the rest of our group arrived (on time!!), I informed the hostess and she looked at me blankly and then the packed restaurant.  She told me it would be awhile. Huh? When asked what \"awhile\" was, she said 20min.  But then seated us in 5 (she had to bus a table which I take it as one of the things she dislikes about her job - that and people).\n\nFood was a let down. Potato latkes were greasy and blah.  Fish tacos were recommended and were basically fried fish sticks.  Pumpkin risotta was heavy and confusing flavor wise.  Others had the same sentiments.\n\nService was rough.  Long waits and lack of attentiveness. Noise level (couldn't converse at all) made the night just a bit harer to tolerate.\nNot sure Pino's will get a repeat visit.  Disappointment:( Facts: I am not a big meat eater.  I am not a vegan, vegetarian or any combo.  I like good food that is somewhat healthy and sustainable.  \n\nAll that being said, I have searching a place that serves great burgers.  I hardly ever order an entree that focuses on meat and it is even more rare that I order a burger.  So I read lots of reviews about Tessaro's.  I expected a dive with somewhat gruff service.  Uh, no, Tessaro's is a tin ceiling, hardwood walled, hand painted mural delight.  And the service was tremendous.  Yes it was a Thursday and no the place was overflowing with hungry people but there was a steady flow of diners.  I must mention that many complained in their reviews about not being seated until all of party was there...uh, yeah! That makes sense to me.  No use taking up a table with a partial party who is \"faffing.\" (Google term if confused)\n  \nI had a medium rare burger with lettuce, tomato, pickles and relish and Dijon on the side with steamed broccoli and cauliflower.  My handsome dinner partner had a medium creamy bleu cheese burger and home fries.  The beef was good!!  This means a lot coming from me a non-meat eater.  The wood fire grill gave a super flavor and both burgers were cooked perfectly to temperature.  My veggies were freshly steamed and looked like veggies, not a mush of frozen overcooked goop.  Mr. Handsome devoured his burger and home fries. Evidence of more satisfaction.  Oh we split a small spinach salad to start.  Our waitress-who I should mention again was great-had the kitchen divide it on two plates.\n\nWill be recommending Tessaro's to others and I have found my once-maybe twice-a-year burger joint!\n\nPS there are options for non-meat eaters:) Dinner& Movie: After the downpour, the thunder clapped, the lightening flashed, the skies parted and \"date night!\" arrived.  My date and I were told there was a 30-40 minute wait and after almost leaving, we made our way through the restaurant to wait in the wine bar.  Hmm a bit misleading.  It was quite humid and crowded.  I am patient and was in great company but...there were some negative moments.  On our way up the wine bar stairs,  I held the door as a hostess directed a party down the teeny stairs to their table, only to be squished by patrons coming up who thought I was there for their convenience and more than happy to hold the door as they pushed past.  Also some of  the patrons at the bar seemed displeased that new faces were coming in and did not seem to want to budge to make any room for ordering beverages.  Anyway, I do not drink so I had literally stand still (think sardines) until some people were seated elsewhere.  I was then able to find comfy chairs to sit in.  There were some appetizers sweating and/or floating in olive oil on the windowsill which I found a little gross.  A not-so-polite employee cleaned up the space and extra drink glasses around me.  Giving me a dissatified \"thanks a lot\" look that made me want to justify myself as not being the slob that left the glasses and plates!  But my date returned and relaxed with a glass of wine as we chatted.  We were seated surprisingly promptly.  We were lead to a small two top near the door.  While not ideal, it was do-able.  I had a salad and the pizza with te arugula while my date hads the fpur cheese.  I loved my pizza and besides one of the cheeses my date also enjoyed his pie.  The pizza crust was slightly sweet and baked just right. (Like I said, I really enjoyed mine and the food is why I gave 3 not 2 stars.)  Thankfully my date was able to help me finish my pizza and there was some to take home.  Our waiter was nice and somewhat attentive.  I did have to hunt him down for red pepper flakes, a refill on water and our small table became quite crowed and yet he did not remove the bread basket/plates.  I grew up in Mt. Lebanon and know that sometimes the neighborhood can be a bit \"snooty-pooty\" but I would go back.

{"text": "Brought my wife here for her birthday and we were lucky enough to arrive on the last of three nights of the truffle dinner. I saw it online before I arrived and dismissed it, but our server (Amanda) sold us on it when we got there. In fact, her thorough and enthusiastic descriptions of each course (including each cocktail and cheese) were a highlight of the meal. Sometimes over the top (\"people say it's the best meal they have had in their life\" and \"the chef took this week off so he could enjoy the meal as a customer--and it brought a tear to his eye\") but we genuinely loved it. \n\nFirst, she made excellent suggestions on the cocktail (mimosa) and she helped us decide on the rest of the meal. Her recommendation to split the truffle dinner and add an appetizer was perfect. We left completely satisfied. \n\nThe cheese was very good and the accoutrements well-paired. When I saw it on the plate, I didn't think it was very much but it ended up being the perfect amount. I also appreciated that they kept the bread coming, especially for the next course: a homemade pasta with pancetta, arugula and I am surprised by the low ratings. I have eaten here on the go several times and really enjoyed the gyros. My vegan friend got the falafel and was impressed as well. Granted, we were starving, but I think it was above average. Ambiance is certainly not their forte--but that didn't matter to us. We grabbed our piping hot sandwiches and hoofed it outside just in time to catch Skyblast over PNC Park. A clear night, fresh gyros and fireworks reflecting off the buildings and river--pretty nice. Chose this place based on the previous review. I live in the Banksville area and have been searching for a decent place for Chinese takeout for years. Particularly, my wife and I have been searching for a restaurant with ample, fresh veggies (with rice and brown sauce or with lo mein) and crisp, tasty tofu. I called Tong's for the first time without referencing a menu and simply described what I was looking for over the phone. They said, \"Yep, we can do that\" and then told me it'd be ready in 20 minutes.\n\nI got there and it's as unpretentious as the reviews say. A regular walked in behind me and asked where the kid was and apparently he was in vacation in China. While waiting for my food (I was early), I perused the menu and noticed that what I had ordered (mixed veggies w/ brown sauce and an order of General Tso's tofu) didn't exist on the menu. I was charged a reasonable amount in spite of this and it turned out pretty good. Not my favorite tofu to date (Mandarin Gourmet downtown wins that) but definitely satisfied my craving. Vegetables were also very, very good. They included zucchini, carrots, broccoli, onions and other good stuff without the typical \"filler\" veggies that you find at cheaper places. With that being said, this place was a buck or two cheaper than everywhere else I've tried in a 10 mile radius. \n\nBottom-line: Best Chinese restaurant this side of the tunnels. Highly recommend. My wife and I like this place. It's always crowded, but you can wait in the wine bar--if that's not also packed to the brim(which it usually is). The pizza is the best in the area--exquisite crust, nice ingredients. Pricey, though. And parking is a pain. Luckily, Mt Lebo parking tickets are like $7.00, which is what you'd pay at a downtown garage anyway.", "user_id": "cp2PUYtZQXrYzhRm7uwXEg", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}
{"text": "My boyfriend and I are in our 20s, and have visited this D&B multiple times. After our visit yesterday, however, I don't think we'll be back. When we arrived we were greeted by a long line of people waiting to buy game cards. At first there were 2 extremely slow workers trying to do this, then one left while the line was still out the door! The girl that was left was more than incompetent, and was taking extremely long to fill these game cards. We stood in line for over 20 minutes before being told that there was another attendant in the actual game room. Needless to say, the line in the game room was just as long, and they still only had one girl in the booth. It was a Saturday! After we finally got our cards we had to wait yet again to get a beer. 2 bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full. It took us almost an hour before we actually could start gaming. The floors were filthy with trash, and the bathrooms: repulsive! I had to use the restrooms twice during our visit, and not only did both bathrooms I used have no toilet paper in them, but there was TP all over the floors, and the sinks were less than cleanly. My boyfriend mentioned that the guys restroom was no better, as it smelled like pee and the paper towel dispenser didn't work. All I have to say is get your crap together. We could see a difference in the type of crowed that was there on Saturday compared to what it used to be, and I'm I have no doubt it's due to the poor service and attention to cleanliness. For how expensive they are they need to staff better on weekends. It's a shame how quickly this place has gone down hill and we will NOT be returning anytime soon! BRAVO! We just had our first Bado's experience, and it most definitely won't be our last. This place doesn't get enough credit. Being new to the Mt. Lebo area I've heard so many things about Beto's. We've tried there, and while it wasn't bad, I just didn't see what the hype was about. I was way more impressed with Bado's! Their pizza was awesome!! Their beer selection is pretty extensive as well, especially for the size of the place. The food came out quickly, even though there wasn't an open seat in the whole place, bar included. Overall, great experience, food, and restaurant. I'm so glad it's a local joint. I love giving kudos to places like Bado's that truly deserve it! I'm not sure what the Mt.Lebo hype is about this place. The portions are small, the place is small, and the foods no more than average. I have been there twice now, thinking the first time might have been a fluke. We've heard so much about it that I have super high expectations. Their wine bar in the back is cute, but small. We couldn't even lift our elbows to sip our drink. While the waiters and service are good, the food is just not impressive. The pasta I got was good, but nothing to write home about. I got a pizza the second time I visited and it had a horrid taste. I don't know if it was the spinach or the cheese but something was VERY potent. They're pricy as well. The only thing I will give them credit for their Italian wedding soup. There's practically nothing in it, as they use think rice instead of noodles, but the broth and meatballs are to die for!

{"text": "I've been to Bar Louie several times and I don't have much to say about the food other than is it average and pretty boring bar food. The one thing different is the option for tater tots which people seem to enjoy. Service is fine and prices average. My most favorite thing from Bar Louie is without a doubt, the Berry Mojito! I want one now they are so good! Made with fresh berries and mint! I must get one every time! You will not be disappointed if you like mojitos! I think they are $10 which some might think is expensive but they are just so good! Good wise, I still haven't had anything I really like and I'd rather just come here for drinks. I have been to The Dor-Stop numerous times and never been disappointed. They are known for their pancakes as featured on The Food Network's \"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.\" \n\nI always get pancakes when I go and my favorites are banana walnut and pumpkin. These pancakes are thick and fluffy and so filling! I always end up taking at least one home. My husband has also tried their french toast which he highly recommends. \n\nThey get busy during the peak breakfast/brunch hours so a wait is sometimes necessary but they move fast with service without rushing you and you get out quick.  It has your basic diner feel. It is clean and service has always been warm and friendly. Prices are very reasonable in my opinion as my husband and I both eat for under $20. \n\nI love the Dor-stop and highly recommend it to others! We have been to Mad Mex several times and always have a tasty Mexican meal. The restaurant has cool Mexican inspired decor and atmosphere. The music is very loud and can be hard to hear at times. Food is delivered quick and service is adequate. \n\nAll dishes are large in portion size. My favorite dish is the mahi mahi fajitas. They are delicious and always enough for more than 1 meal for me. Guacamole is just ok, salsa has a nice spicy kick. They have many options for vegetarians as well as gluten free and vegan which is nice. The one thing they don't do is give free tortilla chips which many other Mexican restaurants do. \n\nI'll keep returning anytime I'm in the mood for good Mexican food. Lidia's has a good reputation as a great place for some delicious Italian food. I have only eaten here once for the Sunday brunch which included a drink, buffet, entree and dessert buffet. I had their signature all you can eat trio entree which was very good and I would definitely get again. The desserts were the only thing I found underwhelming,\ndisappointing and not worth the calories. Maybe it was just the buffet desserts. Prices are moderate but well worth it in my opinion. Atmosphere is classy but casual attire seemed acceptable. The staff was both professional and knowledgeable. Can't wait to come back! I love Il Pizzaiolo and will definitely be back! Italian food is one of my favorites and I am always looking for places that do it authentically and that do it right! Il Pizzaiolo totally nailed it in my opinion! \n\nWhile the dining area is on the small side and it did get pretty loud (keep this in mind because it could be an issue), the food was delicious.  From my wedding soup and veggie antipasti to my pasta pomodora and cannoli, I was completely satisfied and enjoyed every bite. Only improvement could be that the wedding soup was slightly under salted. The pomodora was perfectly seasoned and I could eat that cannoli every day! It actually had ricotta filling as it should! \n\nService was fast and friendly although our waiter did struggle a bit to remember our order. Regardless, it was a fantastic experience and I will absolutely be back for another delicious meal.

{"text": "Every. Single. Time.  Every single time I've ever been in the Dor-Stop, I have been nothing but impressed.  On my most recent visit, I ordered the Guy's Version Jumbot, and my friend ordered The eggs benedict.  \n\nI received an absolutely ridiculous amount of food, which was the best breakfast scambler-esque item I've ever eaten, and my friend was met with a bit of an unconvential eggs benedict, served on a large piece of italian toast, with basted eggs, instead of the traditional poached.\n\nThe service was standard for a restaurant like this, the server had large sections (two servers splitting the entire floor.)  but they were surprisingly on top of us, and when your bill is roughly 15 dollars for two people, how can you lose? For the longest time, I heard Tram's Kitchen was the place to go for great Vietnamese food.  So off I went with another one of my foodie friends last night.  \n\nI walked in, and the decor was...pretty bad, but that's pretty run-of-the-mill for a chinese  restaurant.  Watermelons on the tablecloths, generic wall decor...whatever.\n\nWe ended up seating ourselves, I'm still not sure if we were supposed to or not, the staff wasn't very talkative, I'm assuming they didn't speak much english.  We both ordered the Beef Pho and Shrimp Spring Rolls.\n\nSo first major hiccup, our Pho came out, no sign of the spring rolls, though our waiter asked us \"You want any spring roll?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Yes I do.\" -.-\n\nWell we get our spring rolls, pretty good.  The sauce they brought out with it seemed like hoisin sauce with a pretty odd taste.  One piece of halved shrimp was all I found in the roll, which was a bummer, but it was cheap, so I'll let it slide.\n\nThe pho was great.  Nice aromatics, a hint of cinnamon, a decent amount of beef for the price, and a heaping plate of sprouts and limes to accompany it.  The only complaints I could pose were that it was very mild, and it a bit spicier.\n\nOverall, above average, but my quest for the perfect Pho continues. This restaurant is going downhill.  I used to frequent this location years ago, and loved it!  I returned a few months ago, to get treated to an overpriced, underwhelming experience that led to both myself and my date getting food poisoning over bad mussels.  By the way, it was a first date, nothing says \"go out with this guy again\"  like being glued to your toilet the entire next day praying that you'll just die.\n\nI called them, and told them what happened (specifically stating I wasn't looking for a handout, I just wanted to let them know that their mussels had turned, and they should check their product), and the manager told me that I had to have been mistaken, and that they only keep in fresh ingredients.  They did send me a $15 gift card, which I thought was nice even though that a $15 gift card is the middle finger of gift cards, so I decided to try them once more.\n\nOK, so that was just a fluke, they gave me a gift card, time to put on my optimistic pants and try again.  So I took one of my long time friends out for lunch.\n\nWe walked in, and we were given the new option to sit in the \"Wine Bar\".  \n\nOOOooo, color me intrigued.  \n\nSo they took us outside, up some stairs, and into what I'm guessing was a middle aged Persian's studio apartment above a garage that they converted into a dining room.  We then waited for service for an inhuman amount of time before we were given waters.  I ordered a dry red wine, and my friend ordered a cocktail.  We waited, and eventually got those, and they were actually very nice.  \n\nWe ordered mussels again (cringe) and the meat and cheese plate.  First thing I knew was iffy was the meat and cheese plate.  They replaced the normal wooden board, and replaced it with a plate.  A white, boring, incredibly small plate.  On top of it all, it was more of a plate of lunch meat than a charcuterie!  Blah.  The mussels were good though, and my bowels remained intact, though we asked for bread when it was dropped, and had to ask for it a second time.  What a waste, the broth was actually good, but cold by the time we actually got our bread.\n\nSo I'm sorry Il Pizzaiolo, I really tried to like you, but until the quality returns, I won't be.\n\nTL;DR  Don't go here, there are a ton of cheaper, better Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh", "user_id": "N-OCcNVeCGXVj2Eeg85cAw", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw"}
{"text": "The beer is good. Their light beer, Lumpy Dog, is very good-- doesn't taste like a light beer. When I was pregnant I became quite a fan of their root beer floats, too.\n\nAs others have noted, the pretzels are really good. I'm not a fan of the spinach dip but my husband likes it. Veggie burgers are always good, too, though the staff sometimes seems confused when you order, say, the bourbonzola burger with a veggie burger. Long, long ago, when I used to go to the Rock Bottom in Boston, there was a hot mushroom / sundried tomato / cheese dip on the menu that was fantastic... if they resurrect that I will gladly add another star! I wish we lived closer to this place. They had the most amazing French toast (stuffed with apple butter and cream cheese) I've ever had. I have to admit, I kind of thought Benihana was fictitious until we moved to Pittsburgh... and then low and behold, there was one right near where we live. The food is okay. There are better hibachi options in the area. The service can be okay or awful. One time, we were there with our kids and had an absolutely EVIL waitress. One of my kids isn't a big eater, so instead of ordering her a full kids' meal, we just got a side order of rice and soup. The kids' meal her brother was having came with ice cream, so when we were done with dinner, we asked if she could get ice cream as well. I don't know if she thought we wanted the ice cream free (which we definitely didn't!) but she said no, we absolutely COULD NOT order ice cream separately. You either get it with the kids' meal or you don't get it. WTF? You have no idea how badly I WANT to like this place. They are incredibly vegetarian/vegan-friendly. I just haven't been impressed by anything I've ordered there. Even the chips and salsa aren't terribly good. I do like the bar-- they have great sangria-- but that's about it. The sundae bar is a big hit with my kids, particularly the blue \"whipped cream\" (I shudder to think what's actually in that). The food's pretty much the same stuff you can get at Friday's, Applebee's, etc. I like their salad with the almonds and blue cheese-- they sometimes really dowse it in dressing but it's good. Expensive, but really great pizza. Honestly it's the closest I've had to real Italian pizza outside Italy. The little wine bar out back is fun. This is a reliable Japanese restaurant in uptown Mt. Lebanon. It's kid-friendly, and since we live in Lebo it's convenient. Service is always very friendly. I personally do not like their miso soup but everyone else in my family does. Veggie sushi is very good. They will also do a vegetarian hibachi entree that's not on the menu, but I think the sushi's better. Not a lot of places in Pittsburgh do Sicilian pizza. Mineo's does it well. Do not overestimate how much you can eat-- one piece is probably the equivalent of 2 slices of regular pizza. I actually like their sauce, and the cheese is good. If anything there's too much cheese!\n\nThe restaurant itself is kind of shabby. I don't look too closely at the floor and doubt the grated cheese ever sees the inside of a fridge, but it's nice to have this place within walking distance for a quick slice of pizza. The fact that they have ice cream makes it a good place to take kids, too.", "user_id": "u7rJ_CFbp4IYeT39fNfVDQ", "business_id": "McikHxxEqZ2X0joaRNKlaw"}
{"text": "Good food - Great atmosphere!\n\nService will depend mostly on where you sit - They have a nice covered outdoor seating, if you're out with a group of friends - The bar area is pretty neat with lounge seating facing the bar.\n\nTry the Short Rib Ravioli It's been almost 3 years since I moved to Dormont but this was my only first visit to Dor Stop. I've heard about this place even before I moved here and I was pretty sure we'd be coming here at least few times a month. But nevertheless, I could never bring myself to stop by especially when the line to get in usually starts a block away from the restaurant. \n\nHowever, this past Sunday was a different story - perhaps because we came in later than the normal breakfast hour. There wasn't much of a line and the wait wasn't too long either. Although the place itself was pretty full.\n\nThe servers were friendly and attentive in handling our group of 6. The coffee along with the refill came in time - so did our food. I got the All American Breakfast with a beef patty, rye toast, 2 eggs and the Lyonaise potatoes with onions. Loved every bit of it. My S.O. got the spicy omelete which was needless to say quite \"spicy\" which came with a toast and potatoes (without onions). I was a bit confused since the menu said that it came with fries which I assumed was french fries. Regardless, it was delicious and quite filling.\n\nThe price is reasonable and the portion is just about right. I have been here few times over the years but never ate here.\n\nIt's a great happy hour spot - have a drink or two around friends. The lower level could be bit crowded during happy hour but they have an upstairs where you can lounge or sit at the bar.\n\nOverall, a fun atmosphere - pretty diverse crowd. I've been to Sushi Kim few times over the years and every time I've gone there the food and service hasn't lived to it's reputation of being one of the best Korean restaurant atleat in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe food is okay.. service is mediocre and staff ... not the friendliest :)\n\nSo, if anyone asks me to recommend a good korean or a sushi place... you can say this will definitely not make the list. The sushi here was great! \n\nThe hibachi not so much - We got the hibachi chicken which came with the fried rice / miso soup and green salad. Besides the green salad and the awesome ginger sauce - the chicken was okay and the miso soup .. not so good.\n\nWe also got the david roll , eel roll, california roll and the nigiri salmon - They were all really good.\n\nThe service was good.\n\nWill definitely go back again but only for the sushi and the sashimi This is a decent sports bar - good selection of beer with your usual bar food menu. The drink and food prices are very reasonable for the area - also they do have happy hour specials from time to time.\n\n I come here mostly during the hockey season to watch the pens game and also may be because I live only a few blocks away from the bar. Most of those who come here are usually locals from the South Hills Area. Although it's a bar, you will likely to see groups of families with kids. Also, there's usually a bouncer to check IDs at the door after 8 or 9 PM.\n\nAlthough I don't frequent that often, I do enjoy whenever I go.", "user_id": "udT5L2wjSQC0AnlFx_pZjQ", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}
{"text": "Glad to see that the Big Burrito restaurants are alive and well in Pittsburgh, and dinner tonight was my first time in awhile at one of their establishments.\n\nBit of a complex review.  My biggest gripe with Casbah is that it's Casbah Mediterranean when the menu (at least on this night, but I don't think it changes all that much) offers very authentic Mediterranean dishes.  One lamb dish (not overly Mediterranean) and no couscous or tagine, which are major staples of Mediterranean cuisine.  Even a side of hummus and pita or veggies would be nice.  Nonetheless, the menu has lots of fine options, just none that I've seen in a typical Mediterranean joint.  I think it's a little misleading especially if you're seeking Mediterranean cuisine.\n\nWe sampled several of the cocktails, all of which were creative and well priced.  As for food, we split the bruschetta (prosciutto and blue cheese), meatballs (pork) and the brussel sprouts were quite tasty, beet salad, and the potato gnocchi. So lots of food!  All was freshly prepared with quality ingredients and served with sophisticated presentation.\n\nLots of fine restaurants opening in the area, but it's clear to see that they have a loyal following. Crap!  I can't believe that I missed a \"First to Review\" by just a matter of weeks.  Max's Allegheny Tavern has been a shining star and a \"must\" for my Pittsburgh rotation of places to visit.  Years ago, when I worked on the Northside for Heinz, I spent many a rowdy Friday night here in the basement with factory workers.  \n\nWhat's there to say?  It's a Northside institution and always has a mixed crowd that is super cool and friendly.  The bartenders are friendly and manage to remember my name and drink choice even though I'm here only a few times a year.  My Friday nights here must have made quite an impression!  I love the decor here, dark wood paneling with lots of stained glass, and the downstairs bar is where the naughty people hang.  Jukebox and room for dancing.  The food is very homey and very reasonably priced.  The German nachos are always worth ordering, and they are smothered with Gouda cheese.  The spatzle is also a creamy indulgent treat.  And for those seeking the real Deutsch culinary experience, they have a large variety of sausages and schnitzels.  So it's a sausage factory in more ways than one. Best night of the week is Friday night where all of the old and decrepit playas of Pittsburgh come out to drink.  Wednesday and Thursday happy hours also decent.  For Pittsburgh standards, it's a very swanky joint and the drink prices are decent (wait my SF pricing kicked in...ok it's a bargain!)  I also agree with the other reviewer's sentiments about the food.  Several steps up from your standard bar food in Pittsburgh, and the portions are HUGE for tapas.\n\nTo the ladies- this is the best joint in Pittsburgh to get your SATC mode on. My favorite bar in the Strip District.  Timeless classic that never goes out of style.  They had a remodeled a few years ago, which opened the front of the restaraunt and they they've created a patio of sorts that is perfect for outside dining when the sun decides to shine.  Excellent seafood options, and you'll never go wrong with the lobster rolls.  The hot lobster roll is served on buttery Mancini roll and melts in your mouth. Soba Lounge appears to be the only sign of life in Shadyside.  Moderately trendy 20-40 something year old crowd makes the scene, and seem only too happy to make room for you.  Popped in here only for a nightcap after our lousy Taco Bellesque dinner at the Shady Grove and it was the highlight of the evening.  I've been coming here off and on for years, and the espresso martini is my favorite choice, at only $8 per glass!  Comprehensive beverage menu featuring some excellent wines as well as the darling cans of Sofia champagne.  As a matter of fact, this is the only bar that I have seen offer these besides Coppola's restaurant in North Beach.  if you don't know what they are, it's the grown up girl's take on those Minute Maid drink boxes that your mama packed in your lunch, and definitely a girly drink, but a bit pricy at $11 per can.  Next time I return, I plan to dine here and I can see Soba Lounge being my \"Bar away from SF Bars.\"", "user_id": "6deaMWBaD4P3QjghDoWxrg", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}
{"text": "Another one of Pittsburgh's finest restaurants.  The best things about Casbah are it's very cool atmosphere, good service (a very friendly hostess and knowledgeable server).\n\nI had a wine flight (they have a good wine selection), and several appetizers, soups and salad.  Everything was delicious, especially the complimentary bread and they olive oil-based stuff you can put on it.  Most of the ingredients come from local farms and food suppliers, and I really liked they even gave them credit on the menu, the first time I have ever seen that in a restaurant (shouldn't they deserve at least as much credit as the chef? After all, they spend months growing the stuff chefs spend maybe seconds using).\n\nThe atmosphere is really cool, I recommend sitting out on the patio in summer.  The only negative things I can say about Casbah is the high price for relatively little food and the misleading name (I expected more of a Middle Eastern menu and vibe). I definitely got the best service of the restaurants on Ellsworth from this restaurant, and they also offer the best food for the price.  \n\nThe menu is creative and dinner (soup, salad and salmon) were delicious, but there is nothing that Portugese about this place (except the decor and a very sweet older lady hostess who may in fact be Portugese).  In fact, I think it would be considered a national security threat in Portugal to have a place that serves dinner NOT serve wine.  The government of this state is partly to blame though.  Since when did PA become goddamn Utah?!  But Rendell's gotta get his cut I guess...\n\nAnyway, the place is small and intimate, one server handles the floor.  Minus points for the lack of alcohol,and frozen butter with the bread, but this restaurant is a neighborhood gem. I came here with a bunch of Russian language students who go to the University of Pittsburgh, figuring locals and Russian speakers would know the best bars.  I was not wrong.\n\nThis place is absolutely awesome, with an impressive beer selection and great prices.  The staff is spot on with suggestions and somehow able to keep up with about 100 simultaneous and separate tabs going at once.  At happy hour, I had incredible Belgian wheat beer for about $3 and even the pizza wasn't bad.  \n\nFor the upscale beer they serve, the place isn't trendy or yuppie.  You go to the cooler in the back and just grab your own bottle or ask for a pour of whatever they have on draft (it changes often).  They even let you make your own six packs and walk off with them. \n\nThe music is good, and not played too loud so that you can talk to your fellow pubcrawlers.  Highest endorsement.\n\nTo Rob, ogromnoye spaceba! Fusion is difficult to pull off well.  Have you ever noticed that \"Fusion\" almost always involves East Asian food and American cuisine.  Thai corn chowder?  Are they really going crazy for corn chowder in Chang Mai?\n\nYou never find, say, Mexican-Moroccan or  Ethiopian-Brazilian fusion places.  That would be really inventive.  Instead, with Soba, you have another pan Asian-American Fusion joint, although I don't think I've been to a better one.\n\nThe mussels are incredible, a meal in themselves, and a bargain at $9.  \n\nI had the chopped salad, with fresh mango, avocado, mint, and just a hint of spice.  The best meal I've had here was the mussels, followed by the tuna.  The crabcakes are also good, made with lump crabmeat.  \n\nIf you feel like something vaguely Asian, but not too Asian (ex: kimchee pancakes), you won't find a better option.  But if you want something truly original, you have to go elsewhere.", "user_id": "g1dNwh5uCaaUut10U50tmQ", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}
{"text": "I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant.  Came here with no expectations.  \n\nI was greeted by a large open (garage style) window, that opened the whole lounge bar area to the street.  It had modern furnishings and the staff were quite friendly.\n\nOrdered the quattro formaggi pizza.  Quite good!!!  Great balance of cheeses.  Not too rich at all.  Crust was excellent too.  Can't wait to come back. I ate here for brunch on Sunday.  It's $22 and you may have to roll yourself out after.  It included a mimosa/bloody mary, appetizer, and main plate.  I had the fruit and cheese along with the brioche french toast.  All was great.  They could have had some more flavorful cheeses, but the atmosphere and kind service made up for the lackluster cheese.  The bacon and potato fingerlings were absolutely amazing!  I will definitely be returning for brunch! I came here for my birthday dinner.  I was not impressed at all.  First off, we sat at the booth near where the host has his podium.  He seemed to be in a bad mood and made us feel uncomfortable.  \n\nI did like the nice touch of having my name printed on the menu and service by our waitress was good.  However, food wise, it was just OK and a bit disappointing.  I of course had filet, and I was just so underwhelmed with it.  The flavor was meh and the black truffle butter was surprisingly boring.  \n\nAfter this experience, I have no desire to ever come to this restaurant again. I've never understood the hype of this place.  The food is simply OK, nothing special at all, except that it's a bit pricey.  On a recent visit for brunch, I visited the antipasto bar.  The spinach frittata, was beyond bland.  The coleslaw with apple was surprisingly good.  The rest of the antipastos were forgettable.  \n\nI also ordered the Spring Ramp Ravioli with Crab Meat in a Thyme Butter Sauce.  Sounds delicious right?  Well... sadly I thought the pasta quality was poor, and again lacking in the flavor department.  \n\nI will say our bartender was fantastic though.  He always had a smile on his face and was attentive to all of our needs.  That's the only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of 2. Had a great experience here.  Service was super friendly and prompt.  The chicken tikka masala is excellent as well as the paneer naan.  I also tried the chicken curry, which used dark meat.  I thought it was just OK because of the poor quality of the chicken.  However, the curry was excellent.  I can't wait to go back! Came here to try their famed burgers.  I ordered the gourmet burger, and not bad.  However, it was absolutely nothing special. I felt like I could easily make it on the grill at home.  Also, the home fries were just mediocre.  \n\nI don't understand all the rave reviews for this place.  As for me, I don't think I'll be back. Oh Soba... Always a tasty experience, but you always manage to screw up just enough to not make you a place I would brag about.  Tonight, I ordered the pad thai... meh.  I've had it twice here, and each time, a loser.  This time it had a great taste, but the after taste had too much of a carbon flavor for my palate.  However, the mussels were great and the braised ribs were excellent.  Nonetheless, I still have that burnt carbon taste in my mouth, hence the 3 stars.  Would I go back again?  Yes.  But just stay away from the pad thai.", "user_id": "0LzlRSXLhEsVSWFEvW_5yg", "business_id": "P1fJb2WQ1mXoiudj8UE44w"}
{"text": "I don't think I would have known about Quiet Storm if it hadn't popped up several times in friends' Yelp feeds in the last couple years.  I'm all about veg/vegan restaurants, but I have to agree with other reviewers who wish Quiet Storm's food was *slightly* more interesting.  \n\nHusband and I ordered take-out so we could enjoy a late lunch al fresco at Schenley Park overlook.  Folks working were vegan-hipster quirky, but friendly and helpful.  We ended up waiting about 30 minutes for our food, so we decided to partake in an afternoon coffee to pass the time.  I  had an iced Morroccan latt\u00e9 with cardamom and rose,  husband the Mandorla sweet almond milk latt\u00e9.  Both were excellent.\n\nFor my meal I picked the Tahini Bowl with brown rice, spinach, roasted red pepper, tomatoes, pepitas and fried tofu cutlet with a tahini dressing.  I wished there had been less rice and more dressing; the bowl was also screaming for more seasoning.  Husband opted for the Crunch Wrap Extreme: scrambled tofu tossed with celery, carrots, edamame, kale and spinach, dressed with vegan wasabi mayo.  Again, twice as much dressing would have added flavor and moisture to an otherwise fine wrap.\n\nAnd that's just it: the food at Quiet Storm is fine.  When really, I'd been hoping to be utterly wowed by the magic capable of being worked by nothing more than mere vegetables, plain grains and humble legumes.  Still, I won't discourage you from eating here.  I just might come back myself. Dude.  Pittsburgh.  Who knew you had such a refined and sexy dining scene???\n\nWell, your good citizens, that's who.  Which is how husband and I were referred to Point Brugge, Salt of the Earth, and lastly Soba Lounge, thanks to the brilliant hostess at our B&B who told us Soba was her favorite spot within walking distance.  I don't usually dine without Yelping these days, but I am *so* glad we recklessly heeded her advice.  Our meal at Soba was one of the finest, most delicious, and wholly satisfying that I can recall (joining Salt of the Earth, no less, in that prestigious category...).\n\nThe subtle lighting and modern d\u00e9cor of the joint is coolly lovely, setting the mood right away for a relaxed dining experience.  Attentive, professional service is provided by servers who explain that most of the produce used in Soba's dishes is locally sourced and are happy to make recommendations.  Husband and I started out with an Asparagus Maki Roll appetizer, with tempura asparagus, tamago, roasted local shiitakes, scallion, and a spicy lemon ponzu.  The soft, sticky rice didn't overwhelm the crunchy asparagus, earthy 'shroom, and slightly-sweet tamago; the ponzu dip was a pleasantly sour foil.  We also had an order of Thai-inspired Blue Bay Mussels with crispy soba and aioli, which were *fab-u-lous.*  I eat a lot of mussels, but these were some of the most enjoyable I've ever had.\n\nFor entr\u00e9es, husband and I split the Soba Noodle Scallops -- which arrived at the table with root spinach, cuttlefish, wild mushroom, and fresh wasabi -- and the Seared Tuna -- with a sesame crust, cucumber-red-onion salad, kimchee, ginger fried rice, and peanuts.  Both dishes were out of this world.  Husband I had trouble cutting ourselves off at half and switching plates, but were both rewarded tenfold for doing so.  The scallops had a perfect sear, the soba was fat and chewy, the ponzu wasabi broth was soul-warming.  And the tuna was seared expertly, still gorgeously garnet and cool in the middle, complemented by a crunchy, nutty sesame crust and that flavorful rice.  I don't think either of us wanted that meal to end.  And all things considered, husband and I thought the bill at the end of the night was ridiculously reasonable.  Soba FTW.\n\nPittsburgh, I have a crush on you.  Your perfectly-priced fine-dining scene makes me want to pull up stakes and move in with you.", "user_id": "TYdOKKLtA7LITxV7Y2_wjA", "business_id": "PzG0XmAmtXFs6Fdnubf41g"}
{"text": "If you find yourself craving pizza on a Saturday night, you can't beat $9 for a large cheese pizza. I also enjoy the hoagies as they are lightly toasted for a nice crunch.\n\nI can't speak for the pastas or appetizers, but the Pittsburgh style grilled chicken salad is a dependable choice. I enjoy coming to Casbah because it reminds me of the fresh, local elements I so enjoy about the Napa and Sonoma Valleys. Casbah gets a lot of produce and meats from local farms, and I love that!\n\nI also love the cheese selections here. I usually ask my waiter to surprise me with any combination, and it's always fantastic. I am a sucker for the duck here. It's duck two ways-roasted breast and braised legs. Absolutely delicious. The gnocchi on the side is fantastic. I also like the double cut pork chop with the braised kale, as well as the roasted chicken because the polenta on the side is so yummy.\n\nThe wine list is pretty good, and the waiters are generally knowledgable about pairings, which is nice, because sometimes you just want to sit back, relax, and let someone else do the work.\n\nYou can't go wrong with any of the pastas. It's sometimes fun to split a pasta as a starter. It's a nice way to try a variety of dishes. The orrechiette is a great choice because it combines the tartness of cranberries with the savory creaminess of goat cheese. Yum!\n\nIf you're not absolutely stuffed at this point, try the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding for dessert. You won't be disappointed! There aren't many places in Pittsburgh where you can get an above average large cheese pizza for $9. They also have a traditional pizza place menu with salads, hoagies, breadsticks, pastas, and munchies. The cheesesticks are great when you're craving something cheesy and salty, and their grilled chicken salad with fries and ranch dressing is dependable as well. \n\nOne great thing about this place is that you can stop in and grab a slice or two if you're in a hurry. This place is right along my way home from the bus from work, so I'm always tempted to stop here.\n\nIf you're looking for a great place to grab an inexpensive pizza, check out Pizza Perfectta! Traditional diner with red vinyl booths and diner coffee. Very homey and quaint, and you can't beat the price. I enjoyed the omelette with kale and black eyes peas, and the home fries were perfectly crispy on top. I will definitely be back for lunch or dinner\n\nThere is plenty of parking on Baum, and the place was crawling with customers on Sunday morning for breakfast. I love the ambience here, and the fact that it is so close to my house is a definite plus! Although, it is dangerous to be so close to one of my favorite spots in the city. The tuna is my absolute favorite entree, hands down. The Korean barbecue sauce on the tuna has the perfect amount of acid and heat, and the sesame crust adds just the right amount of crunch for texture. It is served with ginger fried rice and kimchi, and both are always delicious.\n\nTo start, try the lobster maki and the Korean BBQ ribs. The octopus starter is also fantastic if you are feeling adventurous. I am obsessed with the chopped salad. I could eat this daily-no joke. The combination of daikon and mango with mint and cashews is absolutely perfect. I absolutely love love love this salad.\n\nIf you venture upstairs to Umi in your future eating adventures, rest assured that Umi's dessert menu features all Soba desserts. They always have a seasonal shortcake-my favorite is the plum. And the chocolate pretzel stack is pretty spectacular, despite the fact that I'm not really a chocolate person. \n\nThe only person in my party who wasn't blown away by their food the last time I was here ordered the vegetarian curry option. It was just okay due to its lack of complexity and flavor. But, unless you are a vegetarian, you really can't go wrong with any of the other entrees.

{"text": "This is a cozy little place. I made last minute reservations for a Saturday evening because the restaurant we were supposed to go to  closed due to an emergency. Major bummer for us, but life goes on and luckily we were able to get a table at this place. At first we were seated by the register area and that was a little awkward because it felt like the hostess and waitresses were right at the table with us. I wasn't in the mood for a large group dinner so we asked to be moved, a request they graciously accomodated. Unfortunately, we were then seated pretty close to the door and it was a cold February evening so that was a little rough. Fortunately, we had a whole bottle of wine to warm us up.\n\nOK, so now let's talk about the wine thing: \nthis is the first BYOB place I've ever eaten at and I loved it! It's pretty great to share a bottle of wine that you can pick out yourself, rather than spend a fortune on some ordinary bottle offered by the restaurant. I didn't know if we had to open the bottle ourselves and brought a cork screw just in case, but turns out they open it for you; I can't remember if there was a corkage fee, but it they do it's a small fee.\n\nNow, for the food: we shared a sardine appetizer and it was quite good. The bread was also really delicious, very fresh and soft. For my entree I ordered the lobster tail and that was very tasty! The veggies served alongside were cooked perfectly and the sauce was light and flavorful. We ended the meal with a chocolate mousse, which my partner didn't love, but I thought it was pretty good, definitely not the best I've had, but good!\n\nTo sum it all up: good food, cozy place, and friendly staff! My partner wanted to try a Pittsburgh cheesesteak sandwich and we read this was the best place to go. I don't like fries and I don't eat cheese, but I still loved my sandwich! I ordered the chicken sans cheese and fries, of course. The cole slaw was very good; I loved that it didn't have mayo in it and the flavor was great. Our waitress recommended that we try their hot sauce on the sandwiches and so glad we did because it really spiced it up and made the sandwich even better. My partner ordered the real deal and said it was delicious as well! We also ordered a \"small\" beer, which is a full 12 oz glass, pretty sweet deal. \n\nHighly recommend this place After reviewing some of the top restaurants in Pittsburgh I decided that this would be a great place to celebrate our anniversary. I had fairly high expectations and I can honestly say that they were all met! On Open Table I requested a quiet table and the request was honored, which is always a huge plus. Our waiter was very helpful and friendly, even when I asked to exchange my cocktail since I thought the one I ordered was a  bit sour. Fortunately the second cocktail made with honey and gin was amazing!\n\nFor an appetizer we shared the hamachi sashimi and it was perfectly delicious. For our entree we shared the ahi tuna and it was very fresh and well-seasoned. The Korean barbecue sauce served over the tuna was on the spicy side, but not too much so, the ginger fried rice and kim chi served alongside were also very good. For our dessert we shared the chocolate maki and wow, it was amazing! This is definitely a must if you visit this restaurant! It's incredibly decadent and certainly large enough to share. Taste aside, the presentation makes it worth trying: in place of ginger they serve freshly grated melon and what looks just like wasabi is actually whipped pistachio cream. \n\nI'd definitely visit this restaurant again!", "user_id": "AMuyuG7KFWJ7RcbT-eLWrQ", "business_id": "l_Wey2YC6NvVUIH8vTygGg"}
{"text": "Very very good chain family restaurant. I had their yellowfin tuna steak shanghai style and it was great. Service was excellent and the party of 5 I was with swore they could eat there every week as the menu was extremely diverse. It's hard for me to give a chain 5/5 but this is pretty close. Incredibly authentic Italian cuisine. If your looking for a memorable spot with some of the most delicious actually Italian dishes then look no further than Alla Famiglia. This is a restaurant to celebrate an occasion at such as New Years, Valentines Day, Anniversaries,etc. \nmy girlfriend and I came here for New Year's Eve and we could not have enjoyed it more. To start we had the Alla Famiglia Meatball. I couldn't get over the rich tomato sauce that the meatball was surrounded in and the smoothness of the actual meat. Just delicious, must have.\nWhen you order an entree you also get their house salad served in a homemade Italian vinaigrette (light and complimenting to the diverse salad topped with great peppers!) and their Penne Alla Vodka. This pasta dish alone is enough to warrant a visit . I am a alla vodka lover and this is the best I've ever had. It's hard to describe but its not to rich or creamy it's absolutely just right. The pasta itself was so smooth and melted in your mouth with their sauce.\n\nFor entree my girlfriend had their Ahi Tuna Steak (special). Prepared perfectly and with a great lemon butter sauce. I had their speciality, their double cut Veal Chop. This is something straight out of The Flintstones in its portion but let me tell you it's with every penny. I had the Veal Chop Pizzoaloa style wivh was with hot & sweet peppers, a great tomato sauce covered in provolone cheese. This was such a moist Veal Chop that literally fell off the bone and with the marbling it just melted in your mouth. \nEverything was spectacular , it's a restaurant you have to visit if your in the area at least once given you are willing to spend for your meal. $$$$ but you absolutely get what you pay for. Good place to have a reasonable meal. Cool that everything is made out of an extremely small kitchen that you can see but the food didnt live up to the local hype for me.  Burger tasted alittle bland, and extremely large.   The restaurant is also very \"packed\" tables are very close together. Home fries option but no 'french fries.\" Just had dinner at Soba with the girlfriend and two friends.  It was a disappointment from top to bottom as we were excited for a very good asian infused dinner but instead experienced an average at best night out.  \n\nAt first we were greeted instantly by our server and things started off fine.  However once we placed our drinks it took the staff, I kid you not 25 minutes to make and bring 4 drinks. They would have never been brought if the manager didnt approach the table and ask if everything was ok.  After he finally brought them with the time in mind he did comp our round which was a nice gesture.  The appetizers, which mind you were brought out BEFORE the drinks, without any staff paying attention that fact.  Apps were the best part of the meal.  Korean BBQ Ribs, were dry and really needed the extra bbq sauce to make the rib succulent and still the flavor wasn't anything to write home about. The Rock Shrimp was excellent, very light batter, fantastic lightly spicy sauce and spiced well. same shrimp as Umi.  The Softshell crab was pretty good, the heirloom tomatoes and avocado added a nice touch and the crab was prepared perfectly, soft and a good crisp crunch. \n\nWhat really hurt this experience were the entrees. I had ordered the Double Cut Pork Chop and ordered it cooked t\no the chefs suggestion in preparation when it came out, it was a tough pork chop, noticeable without even cutting into it.  I dealt with it and continued to eat it but overall a tough and dry dish.  The accompaniments such as snap peas, lotus root and mushrooms just seemed very thrown together, and didnt add anything to the taste of the dish, did not mesh well. My friend ordered the Roasted Chicken which was a variation of a chicken ramen soup.  For $22 a ramen entree should be out of this world and it was far from that, and it was work to get the dish into ready condition to be consumed. The girls ordered shareable sushi offerings and found them to be just ok nothing greater than they have had at good sushi restaurants.  \n\nThe service was lacking all around our meal.  Apparently it was \"Jam on Walnut St Festival\" which meant that many checked out the soba bar for drinks.  However when I went to the restroom and passed by it looked like a normal bar scene to me.  Not only did our beverages take 25 minutes to arrive.  The waiter never checked up on us after app or entree until we were obviously ready for the table to cleared and when I was served my pork chop I still was left with a butterknife to cut this tough piece of meat.  Had to ask server for a steak knife, which was clearly meant to be served with this dish.  When the girls got their shareable entrees the dumpings they ordered were replaced by shittake mushroom dumplings when they ordered shrimp.  \n\nThe ambience of the restaurant is nice but some of our party had trouble seeing as it is extremely dim all around making it tough to read and even see your dish.  There was a lot of cell phones out at tables around us for flash light usage.\n\nI wouldn't return to Soba it just does not offer enough for me to justify the cost and it looks like right now they are having trouble serving dinner on a saturday night.", "user_id": "Iu9HNWqEKIx-auLSu6QeJg", "business_id": "usSROUMiAgPcxV3Ym0OxMQ"}
{"text": "Great greasy spoon!\n\nArrived early, around 7:15 am on a weekday. Had no trouble finding a seat. Just as we were sitting down, a waitress asked if we wanted coffee. Of course, and how lovely!\n\nWe had a couple of questions about the mixed grill sizes because we didn't want too much, as the reviews here stated that the portions were huge. The waitress was super nice and answered all of our questions. We ended up splitting the half-sized mixed grill, and it was PLENTY!\n\nGreat diner quality, but I think I'll try the same dish without the cheese next time-it was an American cheese, and I don't think the grill needed it. \n\nCoffee was always hot, and service was so quick! This place is a hot spot!\n\nCash only - be prepared. This location has such a different feel than the others around Pittsburgh. Perhaps it's the well-lit bar, or maybe it's that there's a new bartender every time I make it over here. In any case, it doesn't quite have the \"feel\" that North Hills and Robinson have. My husband and I visited on a quiet Friday afternoon, and we were politely greeted by the bartender. We each ordered a beer and were promptly served. After taking a moment to glance over the menu, we decided on the pita pizza app, the special (beer battered fish/Mac and cheese) and the fish tacos. \nThe pita pizza: a soft pita shell with pesto, tomatoes, chicken and cheese. BORING. \nThis appetizer reminded me of my mother's Irish cooking: tasteless. A simple addition of caramelized onions would have solved this problem. \nEntree 1: Beer battered fish and Mac and cheese. Ruling: BLAND. My husband ordered this one and described the fish as \"wet\" and the Mac and cheese as \"play-doh\". They also served the dish with lettuce, tomato and onion, as if it were a sandwich. \nEntree 2: Fish tacos. Ruling: OVERCOOKED/COVER-UP ATTEMPTED. Ok, so they weren't bad, but the fish was dry. Covered with tomatoes and a bit of lettuce, the tacos were, again, on the tasteless side. The attempt at adding flavor came with the chipotle mayo and sour cream. \nThese only helped to moisten the fish. The corn relish was masked by jalape\u00f1o peppers and the rice came shaped as if out of a small flowerpot.\nThe service was quite friendly, so, no fault there. The chef, however, needs a bit of training. My FAVORITE ITALIAN RESTAURANT IN PITTSBURGH! It's the sauce, people. The sauce!! So good. \nOrder the mussels with marinara.\nThen order whatever else you want because it's going to be amazing. Definitely a great sushi stop in Mt. Lebanon. Why the 3 stars? Service. The restaurant was EMPTY. We made it clear that we needed to be quick, but that didn't change anything for the service. It was still slow with everything from the drinks to the food to the bill. We ended up being late to our event, but at least we had full tummies. The sushi is great, really. It would just be better if it came in a decent time. Had the famous \"Birthday Coupon\" and decided to make it worth the free entree. This place has been on my list for a while, and I was finally able to convince my husband make the trip for date night. \n\nThe only seating available without a reservation was at the bar, which is never a problem for us. We were two of the only three people there, and it was really quiet, so perfect!\n\nWe were greeted by the bartender who was very knowledgeable and friendly. He provided us with drink menus and gave us an ample amount of time to decide. \n\nWe started with the hamachi sashimi, which was a brilliant blend of pomegranate, pear, and avocado with amber jack tuna. A spicy little sauce was plated along with it, and the mix was really tasty. Beautiful presentation as well. \n\nMy main course was the Thaikkal curry, which was a fun, educational dish for me. First, the eggplant was fire-grilled, which blended so well with the curry sauce. It was plated with bean sprouts and slices of fresh mango, which I had never thought to pair with a curry. The roti was fried, which I didn't prefer. \n\nMy husband ordered the seafood hot pot. Quite a full portion of seafood with a side of rice, this vast array of shellfish went down quick. His comment was \"It's Big Burrito salty.\"\n\nReally savory food and pleasant service in an atmosphere drowned in Massive Attack. That's Soba.", "user_id": "GYNfjDbSlpdRK2qC8RqatA", "business_id": "b9WZJp5L1RZr4F1nxclOoQ"}
{"text": "At this time, I have officially had every meal of the day at Casbah (it's great!). Here are my thoughts from my three visits:\n\nFirst time was for dinner (June 2014) with my Big Burrito Birthday Coupon. We sat outside, where it was pleasant even though it was the middle of the summer. They were generous with the table bread and I really liked their goat cheese yogurt spread. I got the Orrechiette chicken pasta and BF got the filet mignon. The pasta was ok (see lunch review for update) and came in a large portion. The filet mignon was perfection. I made BF share with me :) The roasted potatoes with the green chutney were also heavenly. Definitely a lovely way to spend my birthday.\n\nSecond time was for a weekday lunch with a college friend visiting (Nov 2014). We had the 2 $10 off entree coupons and ordered off the Gusto menu (a fancy version of Panera's You Pick Two). I got the Orrechiette again and a Turkey Avacado Sandwhich. The pasta was delicious this time, so I'm thinking it was just one-uped by the Filet Mignon at dinner. Friend got the vege risotto which she liked. I like that Casbah is willing to customize plates at no extra charge or nuisance - they removed all bacon items from my entire meal and replaced them with other dressings, etc. I really appreciated that. Even without the coupon the Gusto lunch menu is a great deal!\n\nThird time I went for brunch with another girlfriend (Dec 2014)\n. I LOVE BRUNCH and Casbah took the cake. The table scones, pastries etc were delicious as was the accompanying cinnamon butter. Our waiter was very nice and helpful and was again quick to help customize my vegetarian friend's needs. I got the Mimosa which was delicious. Smoked salmon appetizer was as good as the other yelpers say and the portion was humongous. Finally, I got the scallop omelette and they had no issue giving me my favorite home fries as the side instead of the grits. Friend got the salad appetizer and the spinach eggs benedict. She loved the eggs not such a big fan of the arugula salad (which I have had and liked). We each had a $10 off brunch which made this a steal :) We were able to sit outside even in the winter which was nice.\n\nAll in all, I love Casbah. I'm a student so it's a little expensive for me. But I go every chance I get. Look out for Big Burrito coupons! Went to Soba for an anniversary dinner since we wanted to try something new and trendy. The interior (which I hear was renovated) was just that - NYC style trendy and the ambience was romantic. I had requested a seat overlooking the waterfall when I made the reservation which they said they could accommodate on the mezzanine but when we got there, they said it was closed. So we sat in the side room - not a huge deal.\n\nWe had the Korean BBQ appetizer, which was DELICIOUS! It felt kind of funny eating with my hands whilst in such a nice restaurant wearing a pretty dress, but I would totally get these again. *mouth waters*\n\nFor entrees I got the chicken ramen soup bowl which had a lot of chicken in it (pleasant surprise!) and was nice and hot. I added a little of the hot chutneys to it :) BF got the bim bam bop which he said was so-so. He asked for the egg on the side, but they plopped it in the middle. I'll have to say the service was so-so.\n\nNice for a special occasion and with 2 $10 off entree holiday coupons it didn't break the bank.", "user_id": "plNKzNhFP4fzAvfBlfET7Q", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}
{"text": "We just came back from Greece & I've been dying for an authentic gyro. We were downtown for the Billy Joel concert, I saw Salonika & had to have it.\n\nI had the gyro special which is a gyro, potatoes & drink. Luckily, they let me swap out their spectacular lemon potatoes that melted in my mouth for the French fries. I had the beef/lamb original gyro. The meat was so tender and tasty. Yum!\n\nMy friend really enjoyed the Athena chicken.\n\nThey have extremely reasonable prices. There is not much of an atmosphere, but for cheap prices & great food you can deal with it. There is also a bar in the back, which is a bonus. I highly recommend it. My friend and I were trying to think of a place to go last night for dinner before Mannheim Steamroller and she suggested Tambellini's. I hadn't been there for a million years and am not too thrilled with the downtown restaurant scene so I agreed. It all started when we were seated by the lack luster hostess. You could tell she either just didn't want to be at work yesterday or really hated her job. She had zero personality. Then we look at the menu. How much do you think they charge for simple bow tie pasta and meat sauce? You're probably thinking $10 or $12, right? WRONG! $20!! I was not happy about the ridiculous pricing, but my friend and I felt we were already sitting down and felt funny about leaving so we unfortunately stayed. Now I really wish we would have. I figured if I am going to spend $20 on simple pasta I'll spend $10 more and have a steak with it. I'm on an extremely strict diet of only 1200 calories a day so I could not have the bow ties with alfredo. All I asked for was for them to replace the alfredo with simple marinara. You would think I asked them to get Giada DeLaurentis to come and cook my pasta. The waitress gave me such an attitude and then punished us the rest of the time by ignoring us. After all that I get my meal, the steak is very good (even though it clearly was not well done, some of the pieces were practically still mooing) and the pasta was tasteless. I would have been furious if I paid $20 for tasteless pasta. Never again will I go there. That place is the worst and I recommend you guys don't waste your time or more importantly your money either. The staff needs an attitude adjustment, the prices need to be more reasonable given the global economic collapse and they need to work on creating more flavorful dishes.  The only reason I gave it a 2 is because the steak was good. Otherwise, it would have been a .5 or 1. Every year my husband and I alternate Big Burrito Restaurants where we use our birthday coupon. None ever disappoint. We had never tried Soba and boy were we glad we did. The whole experience was amazing.\n\nWe started out with both types of sangria. The white was good until you tasted the red, which was delicious. We loved it.\n\nOur appetizer was the filet satay. Wow! It was perfectly cooked & seasoned. The meat was so tender and melted in our mouths. We hated for it to end.\n\nI had the Pad Thai and I normally love Pad Thai. Everyone raved about it, but unfortunately I don't think it lived up to the hype. I did not find it flavorful at all. I also felt they could have made it a lesser portion & charged less.\n\nMy husband had the Korean fried chicken & loved it. I thought it was moist & delicious with perfect breading. The only thing I didn't like on the plate was a tiny bit of potato that looked like a sweet potato, but tasted like a bland potato.\n\nWe finished the night off with the pretzel stack. A friend of ours loved it & I did not care for the taste at all.\n\nThe decor and ambiance in the dinning room was great. The lounge was beautiful and looked like a fun place to have cocktails with friends. We'll definitely be back.", "user_id": "wkCe4t2jgiSJz1t4yFZAgg", "business_id": "WXpi9z1bqF9raZSW8z70Ow"}
{"text": "Fast, friendly service of solid comfort food at a price that won't break the bank. It's good for pre-theater/concert dinners, especially if you want something that's not too fussy.\n\nThe food is fine, though perhaps not as out of this world as the gregarious owner would like you to believe. My moussaka was a tad on the bland side, but it was piping hot and hit the spot on a cold night. The desserts were definitely the highlight. My companions report that the homemade wine was also surprisingly good.\n\n3.5 stars It was probably a nice restaurant twenty some years ago: the locale is a converted pretty Victorian with stain-glass windows; the bar area displays a disused grand piano propping up bottles of wine; the dining room still sports a pastel palette of sea foam and salmon; and framed 80's posters of the same color scheme grace the walls. \n\nThe menu is marginally more updated than the decor. Some dishes remind me of food fads from the 90's (e.g., the chef seems to have a penchant for meat and fruit pairing). Overall, the menu is too long and rambling without a theme, covering everything from the Baja to the Mediterranean. \n\nThe food was unremarkable. The bread tasted like a generic supermarket baguette; it was served with olive oil and powdery parm (i.e., from the green can). For appetizers, we ordered the prosciutto and figs as well as the trout and peaches. They were probably the highlight of the meal, but the portions were tiny, and the ingredients were not the best. For the main course, I tried their fish taco, which was on the bland and dry side. \n\nSummary: if you are ever nostalgic for \"fine dining in a small American town during the 80's,\" this place is for you. Pittsburgh doesn't have many Vietnamese options. Tram's Kitchen is the only place I've ever heard people mentioning. Today I've finally visited it. \n\nFirst impression: solid pho.  The soup had a good flavor, though the portion is a little small. I was disappointed that they did not have tripe or tendon, but the beef was cut thinly. The menu selection is not terribly wide, but they seem at least competent with what they do have to offer. \n\nEfficient family service. Simple ambiance. Dinner under $15. Neighborhood restaurant.  Friendly service. Dishes can be a bit uneven. The honey duck, for instance, is dry, but the curry is good. Over the past 4 years or so, my rating for Soba has regularly swung between 3-4 stars. Because my experiences during recent visits have been positive, I am hoping that the 4 stars will stick this time.\n\nOne of Soba's consistent strengths is its ambiance. It offers a swank, contemporary atmosphere (and, unsurprisingly, with an Asian feel). The lighting is soft and pleasing -- great for romantic dinners, but still appropriate for business meals as well. \n\nThe menu also reflects a contemporary but Asian influenced theme. The dishes are a little less innovative than Tamari's, but they are generally well thought-out and well prepared. I especially recommend the beef short ribs (strong and complex flavors) and the fillet mignon (super tender and juicy). The kitchen sometimes seem to have temperature control problems. I have had disappointing seared tunas (over done) and on a recent visit, my \"medium rare\" fillet would probably be considered \"very rare\" by most restaurants in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe dessert is overpriced, but I have a special soft spot for the perennial chocolate maki. This may be too harsh, but I think Umi is the only Pittsburgh restaurant that can rival other restaurants of the same culinary category in major U.S. cities. Perhaps not too surprisingly, it is reminiscent of Morimoto of Philadelphia (Umi's Executive Chef, Mr. Shu, is said to have apprenticed under the famed Iron Chef).\n\nThe menu is not cheap. Since I only go when I'm in the mood to splurge, I've only ever ordered the omakasi (tasting menu). Actually, in the market of tasting menus, a set that is still under $100 is arguably a bargain. \n\nMr. Shu uses fresh and high quality ingredients, and he prepares the dishes with a light sophisticated touch. Of the multiple courses, my favorites are the tuna tartar and the kobe steak.  If I have to point to a weakness, it is that Mr. Shu's range is relatively narrow.  A bit more variety could really bring the meal to a whole new level.", "user_id": "7ffOjgAG5au2IyZGLajsmg", "business_id": "PxP19Rb88OQKiSMl2oWNsg"}
{"text": "fish is about as fresh as you will find in Pittbsurgh. Andy makes waiting in line a joy. Very generous portion sizes, and unbelievable value (2 large pieces of toro for $5 is unheard of! Not to mention I was given a third 1 at no additional cost)\n\nThe presentation itself leaves something to be desired, not the most skilled with a knife, but the guy has to pump them out fast enough to keep the line moving. - and lets be honest, you're not going to a stand in wholeys for presentation.\nHis special sauce is tasty, some sort of sirracha-esq conccoction, but make sure you make note of it if you don't want this on your fish.\nUses a bit too much rice for my liking on the nigiri pieces, I think he could use about half as much. Though I understand he is located next to a primantis, and this is pittsburgh.\n\nFantastic value, great guy. Will return.\n\noh, and I really mean he's a great guy beyond the generosity with the fish. Today he temporarily stopped service to help a little girl find her mother. \"I can only speak for the pizza, but have it on good authority that the same attention to quality, fresh ingredients is extended to the entire menu. I'll be back to sample more of everything, and to order the Margherita DOC again, and again..and again. If you're anywhere remotely close to the area, I would highly recommend a visit. If you're a pizza fanatic - it's worth making a much lengthier trek.\"\n\nfull review with pictures on my site After several incredible experiences at UMI, I decided to give Soba (next door) a shot. \n\nThe design of the place is awesome. Definite 5 star for ambiance; unfortunately the food did not fair as well.\n\nchicken and vegetable springrolls: hot mustard sauce, nuoc chom\n- these were tasty but the description fails to mention that they are fried and a bit too oily. The nuoc chom sauce that accompanied the dish was possibly the highlight of the meal. Like a very light sweet and sour.The hot mustard was passable but nothing special\n\ncalamari: chilies, toasted garlic, mint, uni emulsion\n-I was hoping for a raw or lightly grilled calamari presentation, I guess I should have asked. Again, soba fails to mention these are fried.  As fried calamari go..these were delicious. The uni emulsion was more of an uni-mayo sauce..and the chilies/toasted garlic/mint sprinkled along side added some great flavor. \n\nwild barramundi: sushi rice cake, summer vegetable ratatouille, ssam jang, thai basil\n-I liked the flavor of the fish, the rice cake and vegetable ratatoille, however; they were all too oily. I'd like a light sear on the fish, but this was like a deep pan fry on one side. Veggies were a bit to oily as well. The ssam jang was too vinnegary in my opinion. \n\nvegetarian pad thai: zucchini, green beans, bok choy, tofu, peanuts,\nmung bean sprouts, cilantro\n-rather bland and again absolutely soaked in oil. \n\nService was acceptable, but nothing special. \n\nOverall, I much, much prefer UMI and can't wait until Mr. Shu get's back from vacation. I probably won't be back to Soba, I'll opt for Tamari if I'm in a fusion mood. I believe I've found my new favorite restaurant. After being rather dissapointed with Chaya last night, I decided to go to Umi tonight.\n\nThe staff was friendly and service perfect. There servers watch for you to dictate the pace of the meal.\n\nBeggining with the typical salad with ginger dressing: I was very happy with this dressing, just about perfect.\n\nNext the miso soup: I'm not generally a huge fan of miso soup, but this was probably the best preparation I've had. I could have gone for another bowl. \n\nFor my entree I chose the dinner sushi assortment. This was by far the best sushi I've ever tasted. As cliche as it may sound, every piece (including fin which is notoriously tough) was melt in your mouth good.  The accompanying sauces are not overbearing in the least, they merely enhance the flavor of the fish.  The pieces of nigiri themselves are bite size - as in 1 bite without looking like you're stuffing your mouth.  This is smaller than the giant balls of rice with large cuts of fish you often times see at other places. I rather enjoyed the size, but just wanted to make note of it. The tuna roll was also very tasty. I did not sample any other rolls tonight, but I'm sure I will be back to do so.\n\nMy dining companion had the chicken teriyaki.  The dish came out sizzeling from the back kitchen.  Again, this was probably the best preperation of the dish I've ever tasted. The serving size was perfect, about 5oz of very tender breast meat, with accompanying vegetables and a small side of rice.  More than enough to satiate, without the need for a nap afterwards. \n\nI didn't sample the desserts tonight, but I've seen others rave about them. I will definitely be back, as often as I can. I don't really care to try sushi anywhere else in Pittsburgh.", "user_id": "XXAWNimRCIygYRP4IZTTEw", "business_id": "L5387MoRyx9orlRyYfCSPA"}
